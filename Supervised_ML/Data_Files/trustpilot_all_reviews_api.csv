Be honest ,"I have used WEX before and have pleased with their approach and attitude with honest reviews of their second hand camera equipment. Communication has been good and delivery has been prompt.
But, I wanted to send a lens back for selling. On their website they should they would offer to pay me a very decent amount of money for an already second hand lens that I owned. They organised the collection and it was promptly picked up.
They said that it would take a few days for them assess the lenses condition and then transfer the money.
I then get an email saying that they are not accepting the item and do I want them to send it back or dispose of it. No explanation as to why they wouldn't accept it.
So, now I have had to reorganise my days off, at great inconvenience to me, to be able to re receive the lens and find another company that will take the lens.
Why WEX didn't you give me a full explanation as to why you wouldn't take my item and maybe you should consider doing so so that customers have a clearer understanding. 
Unfortunately, I will now have to consider using other online camera companies for trade/purchasing camera equipment rather than WEX.",2024-06-06T00:00:00Z,2024-06-20T11:10:29Z,3,Russ N P,,13

I prefer to buy from independent…but there are limits - and Wex just blew past them. ,"I prefer to buy from independent retailers if possible. And as such Wex were a good retailer. 

BUT THEY NOW SPAM YOU AFTER EVERY PURCHASE - NO MATTER HOW SMALL DEMANDING YOU REVIEW IT.  IF YOU IGNORE IT - YOU GET ANOTHER - FFS

THIS REPEATS - YOU CANNOT UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THIS AND NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE ASKED THEM NICELY TO NOT DO THIS - EVERY TIME I BUY SOMETHING I GET MORE SPAM. 

SO I'VE NOW UNSUBSCRIBED FROM THEM 

*** REPLY TO THEIR FATUOUS  COMMENT ***

Dear William – 

Firstly, thank you for you prompt reply – although I would have preferred you to have taken a tad longer and actually checked what you are saying. 

SO for clarity : 

1: I AM unsubscribed from your direct mailings. I never said I wasn't. 

2: I STILL GET emails asking for review – repeated ones - EVERY time I buy something. 

You appear to be washing your hands because I am getting spammed by power reviews (whoever they are) as though this has nothing to do with you ! Sorry it is entirely you. 

Who gives them my personal details and tell them every time I buy something – YOU DO. 

With regard to my intelligence – thank you for pointing out there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom of these emails. Well doh,  I have clicked these many times. IT DOES NOT WORK. 

I have chased this and been told it resets EVERY TIME you advise them of a new purchase – so not much b..... use is it. 

Have you checked? NO you have not - just platitudes. SO GO find out my friend and sort it – that would be true customer satisfaction not platitudes. 

With regard to you hiding behind the 'it wasn't me guvnor' excuse it is interesting – presumably you advise another company of my email address and personal details every time I buy something. Is this legal under GDPR ? 

SO please not corporate platitudes but actually go find out – and sort it out. 

It is amazing to me that the mighty much bemoaned Am….. send me less carp that my friends in Norwich. 

I would say watch yourselves it is so easy to lose the customer base you had built. You appear to be letting another company destroy it for you - why not find out.

"Sensitivity to disabled punter, & hitting it out the park!","Talk about getting it right!  I want to thank all at the Glasgow store today; but especially Baz.  I took in my S5M2X to get a couple of Peak Design straps to go with the cage I ordered and was delivered from warehouse to the store. Baz was already dealing with a customer but I was more than happy to wait. I have real difficulties with dexterity.  I can’t fiddle with ssd cards.  I need the camera secure around my neck or wrist to keep it safe. I had ordered a Kondor Blue pro blade handle to save the worry of dropping cards and a Falcam F22&F38 cage to attach it to. I was shown into their Fuji relaxing GHX suite for a a seat and Baz joined me to fit the cage and the ssd pro blade handle, as well as explain the simply magic concept that the Peak Design boffins came up with.  I think it is fair to say that we were both impressed by this kit once assembled.  It looks more professional than I can claim to be right now and it will be be perfect as I go about my new hobby.  It simply ‘just works’ as they used say in California. I was delighted to have gone into the store today.   I left feeling so much less overwhelmed by the new camera and the whole thought of operating it without full dexterity.  I had chosen well but that was the easy bit.  Fitting it.  Explaining the possibilities of adding tripod; when I was ready to a quick release cage and simply looking after me was a wonderful experience.  I left the store having Baz sort it all out for me. The kit fitted and more confident going out than I had felt going in. I am incredibly grateful for the time Baz took looking after me.   I have spent time in some of London finest hotels and not felt team members had ever gone that extra mile for me as a patron, as happened today. Look after this guy Wex.  The team in Glasgow did everything right.   I will be back.  As in photography I’m learning fast that there is always something new or used that you will need. Sooner or later.

A positive buying experience,"I recently bought a used camera from Wexphotovideo and found the product description both concise and helpful. For an older model the price was realistic and fair.

This is one of only a handful of companies which supplies a shutter count for its used cameras, something I consider quite important. They also offer a one year warranty for their used products while some of their major competitors only offer a 6 month warranty. I find this reassuring because it indicates that they have confidence in the quality of the used items they sell.

My camera was securely packaged and delivery was impressively fast. The condition of the camera matched the description provided on the website. I also got a follow-up email providing extra information relating to the purchase.

Overall a positive buying experience.

Set against this is the other side of their operation, sending out emails saying that the packaged has been dispatched when it clearly hadn't been, nor would it be until after the weekend. It's such a simple thing, being honest with the customer, but such an important one. End result - I was within 12 hrs of walking away and demanding my money back. The hard working staff at Wex deserve better - as do their customers",2024-05-18T00:00:00Z,2024-05-30T16:33:07Z,4,David Henshall,,1

Feedback counts - well done Wex!,"By coincidence, I needed a repair to a camera and, through insurers, had a totally different company to do the job. Wex kept me up-to-date with the progress of my purchase and the delivery company advised a date and timeslot. The package was delivered to me in person. There was nothing comparable with the other company; I had to phone the repairers to find the status of the repair (new parts arrived? repaired? not repairable?) and estimated date - a specific date and timeslot was not provided. Unlike Wex's delivery process, the repaired camera was left in the porch without so much as a knock on the door. In fairness, it was sensibly packaged. For service then, 5 stars to Wex, and 1 star to the other organisation. The purchase I made was for a zoom lens. It was not new, but in very good condition, was well packed and frankly, I'm very pleased with the quality and price. Alright, it might have been cheaper elsewhere but since I've used Wex before, I was sure that I could rely on good service and honest assessment of the condition of the lens. Again, 5 stars to Wex. I wonder why the insurers and the other company don't ask for feedback!",2024-05-15T00:00:00Z,2024-05-23T15:57:11Z,5,CheshireChap,,2

I have received an offer for my equipment which I am happy with and again the transaction for this was fast and very professional. I will never shop anywhere else now for camera gear. The service is decide to none. Especially Jessops who have really went downhill in the last 10 years or so. ,2024-05-23T00:00:00Z,2024-05-23T15:52:03Z,5,The Real Angus Og,,1

Although outer box package arrived in poor condition, appeared to have been dropped or squashed? The inner content remained well protected. So initial concern with delivery agent were allayed. Lense condition was described as grade 9+ showing few signs of light use with no original box or lense bag which was fine by me at this used price point. I can honestly say I’m pretty impressed with the lense and used grading having only ever purchased from new not used and would highly recommend WEX with absolute confidence for any future used gear purchase if an item should catch my attention!

Having upgraded my old Apple iMac to a…,"Having upgraded my old Apple iMac to a new 24"" version I have begun trying to link older bits of kit, printers, scanners, Lacie's, Wacom tablet... etc... all with older USB connections and not the new USB-C.
My solution was a Minispuru dock that also acts as a base stand for iMac (colour co-ordinated) and also gives it much more stability. But would it work if I bought the latest Wacom Intuos tablet from WEX ?
Not only did the guys at Milton Keynes shop assure me it would, John actually plugged it into his own laptop to check it would and I left reassured with the confidence it could be returned if not.
Well it does work perfectly... and yet again I am impressed by WEX, a company I have been using for many years for all my photographic needs. Well done !",2024-04-30T00:00:00Z,2024-05-07T20:18:57Z,5,Roy Lawrance,,38
Tried to make contact…..,"Tried to make contact with a member of staff at the Nottingham branch I had spoken to just a few days ago re the purchase of one of three mirrorless cameras and associated lenses.  I was advised by a different member of staff that the person was on his meal break at the time (no problem, we are entitled to a meal break) and he would be seeing a customer after that. He enquired whether he could help but I had al ready had an in-depth conversation with the person I wished to speak to, so no.  I asked him to request the person concerned to call me back.   After a few minutes short of three hours wait I rang back.  This time I was advised the member of staff was not available, he was with a customer, could the person answering help.  I stated I had requested a call back three hours ago and he responded that today is a very busy day.  If I can’t get to re-connect with the person I was dealing with what service will I get when I’ve spent in the region of £2k.  Looks like I’m going elsewhere to make a purchase.

Since posting my original review yesterday I have had a response from the person I originally wished to speak with later in the afternoon.  He was most apologetic regarding the matter we resolved the issue.  Since then there has been a response to the posting from Wex Photographic customer support and a telephone call from the Nottingham branch manager, both apologising for the situation and changing practices.

Well, I can definitely state that Wex Photographic take matters seriously and clearly value their customers, hence my 1 star has shifted to 5 stars.",2024-05-07T00:00:00Z,2024-05-07T18:05:03Z,5,PAUL CLARKE,,10

IMPORTANT,"IMPORTANT: so helpful, literally went in with a box of random Soviet era lenses and asked them to fit them onto a canon eos d1100. This should basically be impossible. But they found the exact piece I would need to make it work, gave me the number and the link and then sold me an sd card at half of the price of any online stores. They are incredible.

Charlie was very pleasant to deal with…,"Charlie was very pleasant to deal with when I visited WEX Nottingham. He recommended me a Canon camera which he had tried and tested himself and thought was best for my photography needs.

I asked many of questions regarding cameras, lenses, tripods, camera bags etc as I was very unsure about what I needed but he was soon able to put my mind to ease and before no time I was able to purchase a cheaper, second hand camera with an all round good lens, saving me hundreds on my first camera! 

I went in again for the second time as a SD card error message came up on the camera and again, Charlie spent over an hour teaching me how to use the camera and answered any further questions I had without any fuss.

Overall, I cannot stress how much Charlie really stood out in the store, he was not only very knowledgeable but his customer service was exceptional. 

He really needs a pay rise or promotion.",2024-04-24T00:00:00Z,2024-05-06T15:58:26Z,5,Iqra Saleem,,1

Throughout the process she was excellent and has helped me trade up to either a Nikon z7 or Canon R6. Great customer service skills and a pleasure to deal with. It’s a pity Park Cameras don’t have people like Dorothy as they were woeful and not interested in helping. In fact they gave false information  to fob me off. I will buy all my camera stuff from Wex in future. Great company with great people,2024-05-02T00:00:00Z,2024-05-02T14:45:29Z,5,Nick Guite,,2

I don't trust them,"I've dealt with Wex, (previously Calumet) for many years both personally and through businesses. I thought that they were completely trustworthy.  I was recently having a clearcut of  cheaper camera gear with a view to buying  a Black Magic set up with lenses for film projects so I took some photographic gear to Wex, Edinburgh. I left the kit with them and they came back with a value of around £550. I wasn't entirely happy so I took the gear back. A couple of months later I took a camera, a lens and a flash to them thinking that I would part exchange it against the movie setup. These were in original boxes and I have the receipts. There had unfortunately been a break in to the Edinburgh store, so they couldn't assess the gear, (the same gear as before) within store and had to send it off. That wasn't a problem for me. What was a problem was the next valuation of the kit as £301, thereafter a final valuation of £72. To add insult to injury I was then told that my camera was a grey Import, (It was bought in John Lewis Edinburgh) that the flash was rusty, and that the lens had mould in it. All nonsense. I was informed that they would happily dispose of the lease and flash for me. (To use a local colloquialism, ""Aye Right""). I realise that this is a business and they have to make money but this is beyond the pale. I asked for my equipment back and they agreed to send it. I received it a few days later to find that the charger was out of the box and the cable was missing. I informed them. They immediately dispatched a charger, which wasn't mine and bore no semblance to the one I'd sent. When I contacted them to ask whose it was they just replied to say that they would send another.  In short I thought that I was dealing with a professional company who valued their customers and in particular valued the merchandise. Clearly Not. The camera, flash and lens have now been checked by a reputable dealer who has passed them all as absolutely fine and in working order. I have left the Black Magic camera, lenses and other equipment which I was going to buy in the checkout bin and am now buying them elsewhere. I will not be dealing with Wex again for any of my photographic or sound equipment. I personally don't trust them.  Update:
In regards to the reply of : your equipment is older, the problem is not the age of the equipment but the complete nonsense about the condition of the equipment which has been inspected since and sold to a reputable dealer for a fair price. It isn't difficult to assess the equipment and it's very easy to make up excuses for poor service. Wex can say what they like in reply to this. I have voted with my feet and bought my new equipment elsewhere.

Used sent as new,"First equipment sent out as new was clearly used (OM1 camera body). Referred to their service arm for a lens but told by the service centre that they do not repair Panasonic lenses.

Having now received the replacement, all is as it should be and it powered up in the state expected ready to select country and time. The previous device had already had this done and to another time zone so clearly it had been used by someone at some time before shipping. The other indicator was a greasy thumb print on the LCD display. I had originally decided to cancel the order completely but having experienced a very positive response to the issue I decided that I would be happy with a replacement and this conversation too was very positive.
The idea of giving me an extra battery was welcome until I found out that it was an Olympus look alike rather than an OM Systems battery. I may well have been fine with that but was surprised when I saw it. That coupled with the repair information is what led me to one star. If the last two things had not happened it would have been a 5 !",2024-04-25T00:00:00Z,2024-05-01T14:03:41Z,1,Paul G,,3

"Great ordering, delivery & refund experience","Ordering and delivery were extremely easy and the item I ordered arrived very well packaged. 
Unfortunately I had to return the item, a flashgun that had been converted to UV. While this was mentioned in the small print as someone new to photography I had not realised. Really if an item is modified from factory conditions I think the product title should make this clear with bold text advising customers. 

I then realised Wex don’t offer free returns and don’t have local stores like CeX where free returns are very quick, easy and convenient. Though their refund process once they had received the item was the quickest I’ve ever experienced. All in all it cost me £14 to return an item that had the description been clearer I wouldn’t have ordered. ",2024-04-08T00:00:00Z,2024-04-20T10:26:07Z,4,Me myself and I,,1

Adam is always very good even carried it to my car for me they are not small lenses it even came with the original Canon outer box as it would have done from the factory when new
 Straight to manchester velodrome and tried it out there  and under LED lights and it being a F4 it was brilliant just need to get used to the narrow field of view. Have used a 400mm 300mm and 200mm all F2.8 and it is a match for those in the velodrome

My go-to store for camera equipment ,"I've bought from Wex both in-person and on-line over the past three weeks. 

The in-person experience was second to none - they went out of their way to help me and all their advise was extremely helpful. They weren't pushing me towards particular products but listened to my questions and answered them appropriately and clearly. 

The online purchase went smoothly. I was kept informed of the progress of my order and delivery was swift.",2024-04-03T00:00:00Z,2024-04-09T10:07:54Z,5,K M,,4
The trade in and purchase didn't go smoothly,"The trade in and purchase really didn't go well with bad communication and failure to do as they had promised. I really don't think the Trade in process has got easier as they'd advertised. I have used them many times before and it had always gone well in the past. Hopefully a one off.
After speaking to Wex they explained the situation and did their best to put things right for me which was much appreciated. ",2024-04-03T00:00:00Z,2024-04-09T09:32:31Z,2,Stephen Bassett,,4

"Damaged my camera, lied about it.","I took my camera in to a local wex to exchange it for cash. I inspected it, a photographer friend did, and also the man at the wex store. They quoted me £348, needing 0 repairs based on their initial inspection at the shop. Which was signed by the employee. It was sent off to wex, I received an email saying the camera was damaged therefore they would be reducing the quote because they needed to carry out repairs. Let me point out, I am a professional photographer, who works as a photographer, and have a camera in  my hand 8 hours a day. I know cameras and I know if one is broke or damaged. The company damaged my camera and I asked for it to be repaired by them, they refused and sent it back to the store. Upon collection I told the man at the store about what had happened, his response was that I am not a professional and wouldn't know if it was damaged. Which is laughable. Upon inspection, it is clear it is now indeed damaged, one of the dials is extremely loose. This happened after it was sent off and the company completely denied it, even though I have a signature from their own staff saying it wasnt in need of repairs. Besides being completely dishonest, they are also insulting. Do not ever use this company. Ive used them for years to buy camera equipment from but it is clear behind their professional veneer, is criminal behaviour. Ive read reviews where similar instances have occurred.

Be very cautious when part exchanging,"After years of using WEX and many thousands spent, I recently had a very poor experience when part exchanging camera gear with WEX.  I’m only posting this review as despite me giving them every chance to privately respond to my complaint, I’ve heard nothing back.
Among the gear sent in to WEX was a camera body.  I subsequently heard back from WEX who said that despite trying it with several flash guns, the body would not trigger a flash.  This was very surprising as I used external flash pretty regularly with the camera, however I had to take their word for it as the camera was with them at the other end of the country.
They offered to get a quote for repair (the cost of which would come off the quoted part-ex value) and I asked them to go ahead with the repair quote.  The quote arrived minutes later and was for approximately £270 to include ‘labour, replacement of parts, calibration and testing’.  As this would leave me with about £10 part-ex value, I asked them to send it back to me.
When it arrived, I noticed that the hotshoe contacts looked a little dirty so I wiped them with an alcohol wipe, fitted a flash and it fired perfectly. I subsequently tried several other flashguns and they all worked fine.
I can’t believe that any technician inspecting a camera wouldn’t think to clean the hotshoe if a flash didn’t fire and where did the £270 quote come from? If I hadn’t asked for it back and had left it with WEX for repair, I’d have paid £270 for someone to clean the hotshoe and would have been oblivious. It would have needed no ‘parts or calibration’ so I can’t understand how they arrived at the quote.
This whole experience has left me vary wary of the WEX part exchange process and I doubt I’ll be able to trust them in future.",2024-03-18T00:00:00Z,2024-03-29T11:23:34Z,2,MR WETHERILL,,16

Excellent experience,"Excellent experience, sold a couple of RF lenses through Wex the arranging of the free pickup was so easy, and they responded to a question I had very quickly.

They checked the lenses within a couple of days and agreed with my valuation on condition, I then noticed that I had selected Wex credit instead of a cash payment.

I rang Wex and the change was immediate, I was sent a link to fill in bank details, and though they said 1 day for money to reach bank it arrived within an hour or so.

I Highly recommend Wex to any seller or buyer",2024-03-26T00:00:00Z,2024-03-27T08:47:58Z,5,exraflad,,20

Great customer experience!,"I have been a Wex Photo Video customer for many years now, and I have just purchased a professional camcorder via the Wex website. I already had a pretty firm idea of which camera I wanted to get, but the clear and informative product information on the Wex website helped inform my decision. The ordering and checkout process was very straightforward, with next day delivery available at no extra charge. The camera arrived on the day and at the time indicated, suitably packaged as expected and with no problems.
I have also recently purchased items in store, and I have always found the sales team very knowledgeable and helpful. I can thoroughly recommend Wex Photo Video.",2024-03-19T00:00:00Z,2024-03-26T00:14:06Z,5,Mr. & Mrs. Taha,,5
Not the usual very high standard expected.,"This review is being submitted as Wex regularly invite me to do so, otherwise I would not recant the story behind this purchase.

Reviews are only of value if there is something which might be learned for the benefit of customers and for the supplier, if the review is objective, balanced, truthful and can be supported by quite reasonable evidence.

The purchase of this recent camera was preceded by a trade -in to part fund the purchase of this model when one became available at a future date… which came about soon after.

A price ( subject to inspection ) was agreed and DPD collected my equipment on time and the following day I received a message from Wex to advise my equipment had been received and would be valued within 2-5 working days.

A week went by without further communication from Wex so I messaged to enquire of the progress.

The response indicated Wex had not in fact received my camera but a KETTLE in its place ( like a sketch we might see in an episode of The Two Ronnies ).

No-one had informed me about this and it seems DPD were conducting a search to try to locate the lost package…. poor communication.

In the message received, the kettle mentioned had a brand name which minded me of a delivery we had received a few days earlier which, because it was not addressed to me, was assumed to contain items for the greenhouse which were expected that same day.. the postal label had the same brand name printed.

On opening the package I found some of the items I had forwarded to Wex… the camera body, the strap and AV leads, which appeared to be undisturbed in the lower chamber of the box.

However, the battery, battery charger, manual, assorted point of original sale documents and the covering letter of inventory were all missing… these had been secured in a sealed plastic wallet in the upper chamber.

It seems DPD had delivered my equipment to a company in London which, thankfully, had the integrity and honesty to return the equipment to me…. albeit with missing parts which had found a way out of the packaging at some point en route.

Wex were advised of this and following exchanges of emails I was assured all the missing parts, with the exception of the original documents, would be replaced and I assumed the replacements would be of the same condition as the original parts… which I had rated at 9.

The replacements received…two batteries and charger… one battery was an older model than my original, showed full life and was ok cosmetically. The other battery showed a medium life and and had clearly seen rough handling with multiple areas of surface damage and heavy scratching to the casing and terminals. The charger had clearly experienced a similar life, heavy marking, peeling sticker, missing the chamber covers and in a generally dirty state, which might have been offset by a quick clean up before posting out.

The manual which I had been promised was not included.

Again I contacted Wex to express my disappointment at the state of the replacements and was advised they were the only items available.

It would have been courteous of Wex to have advised of this before posting out… another failure of communication.

As matters had not, earlier, been clear as to whether or not the original missing parts would be returned etc, I exited the trade-in with a view I would return once matters had been resolved and assuming, wrongly so, the trade in offer would be equivalent to the original offer.

The next trade-in offer was £32.00 less but I still accepted… I was later, however, assured the original offer would stand and the camera along with the replacement parts provided by Wex were sent off.

When the final offer came through it was not the original offer which I had been assured would be reinstated, but the lesser offer.

By this point I had just about had enough and accepted the offer to see the back of this business dealing.

The camera which I have since bought is every bit as described in the Wex advert and although I haven’t yet had chance to fully try it out.. all seems to be well and I am very pleased.

It was advertised as having a manual but arrived without one… I advised Wex and was informed if one could be found it would be forwarded to me. I haven’t heard anything so I assume one isn’t available.

I have been trading with Wex for many years and this experience is not the high quality experience to which I have become accustomed…. hence only 2*.",2024-03-14T00:00:00Z,2024-03-25T23:01:40Z,2,Vincent Ellis,,28

Never fails to be exceptional,"Every time I shop at Wex I know for certain, whether it's on the phone or in store I will be helped by someone knowledgeable and genuinely interested in helping. I also know I'll be chatting with a fellow photographer who on almost every occasion will have first hand knowledge of what I'm enquiring about and can share a useful personal experience. I don't know any other retail place that delivers that kind of service which is why I always look forward to shopping there. Their delivery service is always quick, simple and efficient too so even if you need to cancel it is done quickly and with little fuss. Can't rate them high enough ",2024-03-17T00:00:00Z,2024-03-23T10:34:37Z,5,kevin lake,,10

Love the gear but the delivery was a pain,I love the Manfrotto carbon fibre tripod & geared head. This is perfect for my close-up garden & nature photography. But the whole buying experience was let down by DPD. I checked on the status of my order on the Thursday evening and DPD were saying that they were not yet in possession of the parcel. On the Friday I left the house early and when I checked my email at the earliest opportunity I found that DPD had tried to deliver it but had taken it away again because nobody was at home. I wasn't expecting them! I then had to wait until the following Monday to receive my parcel. When it arrived the box was totally battered (I have photos) and I had to check the contents before accepting the delivery. Luckily the contents inside were in individual boxes and were undamaged. But I will not be ordering anything further from Wex as long as you are using DPD. They have let me down badly in the past.,2024-03-07T00:00:00Z,2024-03-20T22:09:15Z,3,Paul F.,,1

Part Exchange Is Very Risky,"I have been a Wex customer for five years and spent in excess of £17k over that time. I've had a number of Part Exchange transactions which have been OK. I recently bought a new camera body and traded in my old one. I was quoted a price which seemed fair. I took the camera to the Milton Keynes store as I do not trust couriers. I was given a receipt for the camera but it was not inspected. A few days later I was told the camera's LCD screen was damaged and needed repair. I explained that the camera was not damaged when I handed it into the store. I'm an honest person who would not dream of attempting to trade in a broken item, but that counted for nothing. I discovered that I had no protection after handing over my camera to Wex - all the risk was mine, which is not acceptable. I was quoted £180 to repair the screen or simply get back a broken camera. I accepted the quote as I could see no sensible alternative. The quote then increased significantly but once again I could see no alternative. No details of the repair quotes were provided. The transaction is now complete and instead of £750 trade-in I am left with about £500. Do not trade in your goods unless you are prepared to accept all the risks or you are able to prove that your kit was fully functional before you hand it over - you will have no comeback. I won't be spending any more money at Wex.",2024-03-18T00:00:00Z,2024-03-19T11:05:40Z,1,Jorganmeister,,1

I had to log on to my account and delve through my orders to find out that only 1 was in stock.  I would like to have known that bit of info when the order was placed as I might have needed the items for a deadline and could have ordered from another supplier able to meet my deadline. Equally the paperwork with the single item should have included an explanation of the shortage and when the outstanding items would be delivered. I had to call to ask when I could expect delivery of the outstanding items. Again this is something Wex should communicate immediately rather than leaving it to the customer to log on for half the story and then have to phone to get the delivery date.
I did receive an email after several days informing me of the expected delivery date of the outstanding items.",2024-03-11T00:00:00Z,2024-03-18T04:19:51Z,4,PeterB,,1

Initial problem was sorted out by Wex Manager,"Very disappointed with my recent experience with WEX used equipment.  I placed an order for a used Canon EF 70-200 f/4 IS USM lens which was graded condition 9+, I received the non-IS variant which I had to return. 

I spoke with WEX online and they reassured me the 9+ condition lens was available and would be sent out out me.  

Then I received emails stating that a 9- lens would be sent out, I queried this and was told it was just part of their automated process and the correct lens would be sent out.  

The next day I was told again that a 9- lens would be sent out as the 9+ lens was no longer available (no explanation was given as to where the original lens had gone).  

Very disappointed with the initial failure to fulfil the order as made, then the subsequent mixed-messages were very disappointing.  

At no point was anyone from WEX willing to explain what had gone wrong and where the original 9+ lens that I had ordered had gone :-(


UPDATE Tuesday 13th March - After speaking with Peter from Wex on the telephone last week, he was able to find me a suitable replacement lens which I am now very happy with.  Thanks to Peter for his excellent customer service skills.",2024-03-08T00:00:00Z,2024-03-11T01:13:18Z,4,James,,1
