I resorted to joining the checkout line to get assistance. I waited in that line for HALF AN HOUR. I'd have thought it obvious that if you're going to spend ten minutes with every person in line, you ought to have more than two people on the till. I know that stores get short staffed sometimes, but this was absurd, and there was precisely zero urgency in the behaviour of any of the employees.

I don't normally complete online reviews, because frankly I have better things to be doing, and if they want my time they should pay for it. But this one writes itself, doesn't it?  Basically, shop with Wex if you wan a decent service but then want to be bombarded with emails asking for a review.

11/01/2016,Wex Photo Video,,614293,2,Not impressed,"It's very annoying that the website shows you a product, you order it, then you get a email saying it's not in stock and they don't know when it's coming back into stock. It's only a tripod!! You order on 27th of December and get your goods 2 weeks later despite paying for express delivery.

08/10/2015,Wex Photo Video,,614293,2,Not ideal.,"Not ideal. I phoned to ask about free 24hr delivery for a £120 order and was told that its not possible.  I then found a 'voucher' on line making it possible - the phone staff should have known this and should have offered it. Then I tried to use paypal but there is a BUG in the WEX site meaning that paypal is sent the """"invoice"""" address and not the """"Delivery"""" address. Both addresses are authenticated by Paypal and both addresses have previously been sent to by WEX. THIS IS NOT an issue with PayPal not holding the correct address. This IS an issue with the WEX site failing to use the DELIVERY address when contacting Paypal. Come on WEX - get yer finger out!! if you don't want to post to autehnticated PayPal addresses that you have previously delivered to - Have the BALLS to say so and stop giving your customers the runaround. I don't mind paying a little over the odds for goods and delivery if its done right - I'm left wondering why I didn't order from a discounted supplier (next time?)",,GB,en_GB,Anonymous,,aax14770,Published,TRUE,,28894214

Sorted helpfully by phone order. Paid extra for next day delivery. Stayed in that day and next day. Eventually arrived after 4 days.

Parcel went back to depot twice as driver run out of time. Numerous phone calls made with little result.  But finally got a delivery date and time. Excuse was that they are using contract drivers and causing problems. Will never use them again. Any orders I may place in future must be guaranteed with different delivery company.
