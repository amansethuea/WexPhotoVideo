1,Trustpilot,0,"i prefer to buy from independent retailers if possible. and as such wex were a good retailer. but they now spam you after every purchase - no matter how small demanding you review it. if you ignore it - you get another - ffs this repeats - you cannot unsubscribe from this and no matter how many times i have asked them nicely to not do this - every time i buy something i get more spam. so i have now unsubscribed from them  reply to their fatuous comment  dear william – firstly, thank you for you prompt reply – although i would have preferred you to have taken a tad longer and actually checked what you are saying. so for clarity : 1: i am unsubscribed from your direct mailings. i never said i was not. 2: i still get emails asking for review – repeated ones - every time i buy something. you appear to be washing your hands because i am getting spammed by power reviews  as though this has nothing to do with you ! sorry it is entirely you. who gives them my personal details and tell them every time i buy something – you do. with regard to my intelligence – thank you for pointing out there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom of these emails. well doh, i have clicked these many times. it does not work. i have chased this and been told it resets every time you advise them of a new purchase – so not much b. use is it. have you checked? no you have not - just platitudes. so go find out my friend and sort it – that would be true customer satisfaction not platitudes. with regard to you hiding behind the 'it was not me guvnor' excuse it is interesting – presumably you advise another company of my email address and personal details every time i buy something. is this legal under gdpr ? so please not corporate platitudes but actually go find out – and sort it out. it is amazing to me that the mighty much bemoaned am…. send me less carp that my friends in norwich. i would say watch yourselves it is so easy to lose the customer base you had built. you appear to be letting another company destroy it for you - why not find out.",Negative,{'Delivery'}

5,Trustpilot,2,"by coincidence, i needed a repair to a camera and, through insurers, had a totally different company to do the job. wex kept me up-to-date with the progress of my purchase and the delivery company advised a date and timeslot. the package was delivered to me in person. there was nothing comparable with the other company; i had to phone the repairers to find the status of the repair  and estimated date - a specific date and timeslot was not provided. unlike wex's delivery process, the repaired camera was left in the porch without so much as a knock on the door. in fairness, it was sensibly packaged. for service then, 5 stars to wex, and 1 star to the other organisation. the purchase i made was for a zoom lens. it was not new, but in very good condition, was well packed and frankly, i am very pleased with the quality and price. alright, it might have been cheaper elsewhere but since i have used wex before, i was sure that i could rely on good service and honest assessment of the condition of the lens. again, 5 stars to wex. i wonder why the insurers and the other company do not ask for feedback!",Positive,"{'Packaging', 'Electronics'}"

1,Trustpilot,0,"i have dealt with wex, for many years both personally and through businesses. i thought that they were completely trustworthy. i was recently having a clearcut of cheaper camera gear with a view to buying a black magic set up with lenses for film projects so i took some photographic gear to wex, edinburgh. i left the kit with them and they came back with a value of around £550. i was not entirely happy so i took the gear back. a couple of months later i took a camera, a lens and a flash to them thinking that i would part exchange it against the movie setup. these were in original boxes and i have the receipts. there had unfortunately been a break in to the edinburgh store, so they could not assess the gear, within store and had to send it off. that was not a problem for me. what was a problem was the next valuation of the kit as £301, thereafter a final valuation of £72. to add insult to injury i was then told that my camera was a grey import, that the flash was rusty, and that the lens had mould in it. all nonsense. i was informed that they would happily dispose of the lease and flash for me. . i realise that this is a business and they have to make money but this is beyond the pale. i asked for my equipment back and they agreed to send it. i received it a few days later to find that the charger was out of the box and the cable was missing. i informed them. they immediately dispatched a charger, which was not mine and bore no semblance to the one i would sent. when i contacted them to ask whose it was they just replied to say that they would send another. in short i thought that i was dealing with a professional company who valued their customers and in particular valued the merchandise. clearly not. the camera, flash and lens have now been checked by a reputable dealer who has passed them all as absolutely fine and in working order. i have left the black magic camera, lenses and other equipment which i was going to buy in the checkout bin and am now buying them elsewhere. i will not be dealing with wex again for any of my photographic or sound equipment. i personally do not trust them. update: in regards to the reply of : your equipment is older, the problem is not the age of the equipment but the complete nonsense about the condition of the equipment which has been inspected since and sold to a reputable dealer for a fair price. it is not difficult to assess the equipment and it is very easy to make up excuses for poor service. wex can say what they like in reply to this. i have voted with my feet and bought my new equipment elsewhere.",Negative,"{'Customer service', 'Product', 'Payment', 'General', 'Electronics'}"

2,Trustpilot,0,"after years of using wex and many thousands spent, i recently had a very poor experience when part exchanging camera gear with wex. i am only posting this review as despite me giving them every chance to privately respond to my complaint, i have heard nothing back. among the gear sent in to wex was a camera body. i subsequently heard back from wex who said that despite trying it with several flash guns, the body would not trigger a flash. this was very surprising as i used external flash pretty regularly with the camera, however i had to take their word for it as the camera was with them at the other end of the country. they offered to get a quote for repair  and i asked them to go ahead with the repair quote. the quote arrived minutes later and was for approximately £270 to include ‘labour, replacement of parts, calibration and testing’. as this would leave me with about £10 part-ex value, i asked them to send it back to me. when it arrived, i noticed that the hotshoe contacts looked a little dirty so i wiped them with an alcohol wipe, fitted a flash and it fired perfectly. i subsequently tried several other flashguns and they all worked fine. i cannot believe that any technician inspecting a camera would not think to clean the hotshoe if a flash did not fire and where did the £270 quote come from? if i had not asked for it back and had left it with wex for repair, i would have paid £270 for someone to clean the hotshoe and would have been oblivious. it would have needed no ‘parts or calibration’ so i cannot understand how they arrived at the quote. this whole experience has left me vary wary of the wex part exchange process and i doubt i will be able to trust them in future.",Negative,"{'General', 'Electronics', 'Customer service'}"

2,Trustpilot,0,"this review is being submitted as wex regularly invite me to do so, otherwise i would not recant the story behind this purchase. reviews are only of value if there is something which might be learned for the benefit of customers and for the supplier, if the review is objective, balanced, truthful and can be supported by quite reasonable evidence. the purchase of this recent camera was preceded by a trade -in to part fund the purchase of this model when one became available at a future date… which came about soon after. a price  was agreed and dpd collected my equipment on time and the following day i received a message from wex to advise my equipment had been received and would be valued within 2-5 working days. a week went by without further communication from wex so i messaged to enquire of the progress. the response indicated wex had not in fact received my camera but a kettle in its place. no-one had informed me about this and it seems dpd were conducting a search to try to locate the lost package…. poor communication. in the message received, the kettle mentioned had a brand name which minded me of a delivery we had received a few days earlier which, because it was not addressed to me, was assumed to contain items for the greenhouse which were expected that same day. the postal label had the same brand name printed. on opening the package i found some of the items i had forwarded to wex… the camera body, the strap and av leads, which appeared to be undisturbed in the lower chamber of the box. however, the battery, battery charger, manual, assorted point of original sale documents and the covering letter of inventory were all missing… these had been secured in a sealed plastic wallet in the upper chamber. it seems dpd had delivered my equipment to a company in london which, thankfully, had the integrity and honesty to return the equipment to me…. albeit with missing parts which had found a way out of the packaging at some point en route. wex were advised of this and following exchanges of emails i was assured all the missing parts, with the exception of the original documents, would be replaced and i assumed the replacements would be of the same condition as the original parts… which i had rated at 9. the replacements received…two batteries and charger… one battery was an older model than my original, showed full life and was ok cosmetically. the other battery showed a medium life and and had clearly seen rough handling with multiple areas of surface damage and heavy scratching to the casing and terminals. the charger had clearly experienced a similar life, heavy marking, peeling sticker, missing the chamber covers and in a generally dirty state, which might have been offset by a quick clean up before posting out. the manual which i had been promised was not included. again i contacted wex to express my disappointment at the state of the replacements and was advised they were the only items available. it would have been courteous of wex to have advised of this before posting out… another failure of communication. as matters had not, earlier, been clear as to whether or not the original missing parts would be returned etc, i exited the trade-in with a view i would return once matters had been resolved and assuming, wrongly so, the trade in offer would be equivalent to the original offer. the next trade-in offer was £32. 00 less but i still accepted… i was later, however, assured the original offer would stand and the camera along with the replacement parts provided by wex were sent off. when the final offer came through it was not the original offer which i had been assured would be reinstated, but the lesser offer. by this point i had just about had enough and accepted the offer to see the back of this business dealing. the camera which i have since bought is every bit as described in the wex advert and although i have not yet had chance to fully try it out. all seems to be well and i am very pleased. it was advertised as having a manual but arrived without one… i advised wex and was informed if one could be found it would be forwarded to me. i have not heard anything so i assume one is not available. i have been trading with wex for many years and this experience is not the high quality experience to which i have become accustomed…. hence only 2.",Neutral,"{'Product', 'Packaging', 'Delivery', 'Electronics'}"

1,PowerReviews,0,your website offered me two options. one to go to checkout one to go directly to paypal. i chose paypal that transaction took the payment but did not link back to your shopping trolly item or checkout process. so my money is now held in limbo for up to 28 days until your system does not request the payment. the request will not happen because there is no record of the transaction on your systems. i have had to go through the checkout option on your website to purchase the item again. this time your system took my details and then forwarded me to paypal to take payment which is recorded on your system and a delivery has been booked. i will now have to wait up to 28 days to receive my refund from paypal. i will check with other sites to check their stocks before purchasing through wex on line again.,Negative,"{'Payment', 'Delivery'}"

5,Trustpilot,2,"although the item was out of stock at the time i ordered, the company were excellent at keeping in touch with me right up until my order had been dispatched.",Positive,
5,Trustpilot,2,"by coincidence, i needed a repair to a camera and, through insurers, had a totally different company to do the job. wex kept me up-to-date with the progress of my purchase and the delivery company advised a date and timeslot. the package was delivered to me in person. there was nothing comparable with the other company; i had to phone the repairers to find the status of the repair  and estimated date - a specific date and timeslot was not provided. unlike wex's delivery process, the repaired camera was left in the porch without so much as a knock on the door. in fairness, it was sensibly packaged. for service then, 5 stars to wex, and 1 star to the other organisation. the purchase i made was for a zoom lens. it was not new, but in very good condition, was well packed and frankly, i am very pleased with the quality and price. alright, it might have been cheaper elsewhere but since i have used wex before, i was sure that i could rely on good service and honest assessment of the condition of the lens. again, 5 stars to wex. i wonder why the insurers and the other company do not ask for feedback!",Positive,
5,Trustpilot,2,i have purchased a fulifilm xt5 with a 16-80 kit lens and also a 23mm f2 prime lens. the online transaction and delivery were very efficient. i also visited the glasgow store to sell some equipment to wex and was blown away by the size of the store and the amount of equipment on display. i have received an offer for my equipment which i am happy with and again the transaction for this was fast and very professional. i will never shop anywhere else now for camera gear. the service is decide to none. especially jessops who have really went downhill in the last 10 years or so.,Positive,
5,Trustpilot,2,"first class service - i purchased a camera lens at lunchtime on friday and it was delivered the following monday morning, post free ! the lens was in superb condition, exactly as advertised and looked totally unused and was priced much lower than similar items featured on a well known internet and having the benefit of a proper guarantee and no inflated 'shipping' costs. well done wex and thank you very much for some proper service.",Positive,
