I rang yet again, and the customer adviser promised to track the parcel and to call back very soon with the information.  This never happened.  My wife attempted to call them, but after waiting 20 minutes on hold, eventually abandoned the call.  So, I am left without the item I paid for and with no knowledge of its whereabouts in the system.  I work full time and can ill afford taking time off to wait for a parcel that never comes.

05/01/2016,Wex Photo Video,,614293,1,Wex Photographic Good - Parcelforce a Disaster.,"Dealing with Wex was simple & reliable and it is always good to know you are buying genuine EU stock & not grey when dealing with cameras. There were no problems placing the order & again Wex had the parcel ready for delivery by courier on New Years Eve (31/Dec/2015) as promised i.e. it was packed & with the courier. Now the problems started i.e. you are now dealing with Parcelforce - a courier service - and the parcel was sent by Wex using the Parcelforce, """"Express 24hour Service"""". The only thing """"express"""" about the service was the rate at which the Newport (Gwent) depot came up with excuses for not delivering. It took much persistence & about 6 phone calls (including to the National complaints line for Parcelforce) before delivery was completed on Sunday 3rd January 2016. I make that approximately 72 hours for their Express24 service. My wife took receipt of the parcel  - I was still in bed at 8am on Sunday morning - and when I saw the package it was immediately obvious that  the package had (e.g.) been kicked, leaving a hole in the outer packaging which was shaped exactly like the toecap of a shoe. I knew from experience that the camera (Nikon D750) would be well packed in at least one other box inside the outer packaging - and it seems to be working OK; need to run checks on focus accuracy etc but basic functions, menus operations are all OK. Bottom line - Wex are good to deal with; reliable and knowledgeable. However, as long as they continue to use Parcelforce as their courier, I simply cannot recommend them. Parcelforce is not """"poor"""", it is truely an abysmal company to deal with on any level and has hugley influenced ( for the worse) what was otherwise a pleasant experience.",,South Wales,en_GB,Anonymous,,netalyst,Published,TRUE,,28938847

05/01/2016,Wex Photo Video,,614293,1,Wex Photographic Good - Parcelforce a Disaster.,"Dealing with Wex was simple & reliable and it is always good to know you are buying genuine EU stock & not grey when dealing with cameras. There were no problems placing the order & again Wex had the parcel ready for delivery by courier on New Years Eve (31/Dec/2015) as promised i.e. it was packed & with the courier. Now the problems started i.e. you are now dealing with Parcelforce - a courier service - and the parcel was sent by Wex using the Parcelforce, """"Express 24hour Service"""". The only thing """"express"""" about the service was the rate at which the Newport (Gwent) depot came up with excuses for not delivering. It took much persistence & about 6 phone calls (including to the National complaints line for Parcelforce) before delivery was completed on Sunday 3rd January 2016. I make that approximately 72 hours for their Express24 service. My wife took receipt of the parcel  - I was still in bed at 8am on Sunday morning - and when I saw the package it was immediately obvious that  the package had (e.g.) been kicked, leaving a hole in the outer packaging which was shaped exactly like the toecap of a shoe. I knew from experience that the camera (Nikon D750) would be well packed in at least one other box inside the outer packaging - and it seems to be working OK; need to run checks on focus accuracy etc but basic functions, menus operations are all OK. Bottom line - Wex are good to deal with; reliable and knowledgeable. However, as long as they continue to use Parcelforce as their courier, I simply cannot recommend them. Parcelforce is not """"poor"""", it is truely an abysmal company to deal with on any level and has hugley influenced ( for the worse) what was otherwise a pleasant experience.",FALSE,South Wales,en_GB,Verified Reviewer,andrea.mike@talktalk.net,netalyst,Published,TRUE,,28826848

I received a refund but I do wonder what would have happened if I forgot to chase them. Not great. Wex are usually superb and I have used them many times (and since this incident) but this was a poor experience.

17/10/2017,Wex Photo Video,,614293,1,Never again,"I placed an order on a Monday, as I was told it was in stock. Received confirmation but no tracking number. Had to chase over the phone and was told it was dispatched on Wednesday. No email confirmation and no correspondence from Wex. I had to chase the order again on Friday to be told Wex would email my tracking number - nothing received even after several phone calls. Chased again on Monday to be told item had left the warehouse. Then told it had been sent to a wrong customer who had ordered a lesser model than my order. But could not be tracked. Then told the the item was now not in stock. Given the option to cancel order or await further outcome. To cancel order would have validated my credit score as this was purchased through Barclays finance. Tuesday - still awaiting feedback as to what my options are. In total 8 phone calls and still no resolution. This is the worse service I have ever had from a 'trusted' supplier. I have felt that it has be me who has had to do all the chasing and pushing to get it resolved. The saving grace is that I do believe and hope that the new person I am dealing with at Wex will get it sorted for me. Not good. I had ordered this Epson SCP800 printer from Wex as they told me it was in stock and available for immediate dispatch. I had an exhibition of print the following week (now this week) and gave myself what I believed plenty of time to receive the printer and print my prints. now I have had to use another supplier to print and this exercise has now cost me money.

I have an issue with the Bushnell night vision scopes though. It is not clear from the website that they are not image intensifiers. They are a red/infra red light torch and red/infra red light sensitive camera. If the torch is off they don't work. This means they have significant operational differences from an image intensifier that may have an optional red light. The Bushnell's field of view is really small, which I imagine is to allow the red light to be a concentrated and aid distance viewing. The distance isn't that far though. Trees at 50m were difficult to see and if there is anything in the foreground, it is far too bright and obscures other objects.  I think it could be clearer on the website and there could be some differentiation from the Yukons which I think all feature image intensification.",FALSE,Devon,en_GB,Anonymous,,Matt,Published,TRUE,,189619443

I asked why the offer was still visible online & what the finishing date for the offer was. I was told that the offer had ended nearly a whole week earlier & that they did not know why the offer was still visible. I had also asked why there were no visible end dates on any of the promotion or even the promotional emails. I was asked what products I was interested in, to see if they could honor the deal but unfortunately they would be losing margin if they honored it. I was then offered a discount which I was willing to accept to then be told it could only be redeemed through telephone. There is a larger issue with this as I explained to the employee, as I am hard of hearing & struggle with anxiety that I could not phone the company. I found this highly off putting of the company and not inclusive. Because of this I was unable to find out how much of a discount I would have received if I could phone instead I was then offered a £5 credit voucher.

I rang yet again, and the customer adviser promised to track the parcel and to call back very soon with the information.  This never happened.  My wife attempted to call them, but after waiting 20 minutes on hold, eventually abandoned the call.  So, I am left without the item I paid for and with no knowledge of its whereabouts in the system.  I work full time and can ill afford taking time off to wait for a parcel that never comes.
