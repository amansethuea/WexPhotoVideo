Easy service but dry salesperson,"Called to try and have a chat with a salesperson about placing an order but he was very dry and didn't really seem he wanted to talk me through and help, more just get the order done.

Nice product but heavier than advertised. ,"The product weighs quite a bit more than the weight quoted in online details; even the box it comes in states the weight as 930g, so no excuse for this error. 
The product’s two information sheets are inadequate, being difficult to discern and containing several poorly translated sections.
Apart from this, the product seems to a well made item and I hope it will prove to be useful. ",2024-03-15T00:00:00Z,2024-03-22T11:06:41Z,3,Peter Munro,,8

Love the gear but the delivery was a pain,I love the Manfrotto carbon fibre tripod & geared head. This is perfect for my close-up garden & nature photography. But the whole buying experience was let down by DPD. I checked on the status of my order on the Thursday evening and DPD were saying that they were not yet in possession of the parcel. On the Friday I left the house early and when I checked my email at the earliest opportunity I found that DPD had tried to deliver it but had taken it away again because nobody was at home. I wasn't expecting them! I then had to wait until the following Monday to receive my parcel. When it arrived the box was totally battered (I have photos) and I had to check the contents before accepting the delivery. Luckily the contents inside were in individual boxes and were undamaged. But I will not be ordering anything further from Wex as long as you are using DPD. They have let me down badly in the past.,2024-03-07T00:00:00Z,2024-03-20T22:09:15Z,3,Paul F.,,1

Canon printer free paper offer,I ordered a Canon printer online which was advertised as having 25 sheets of A2 Canon mat paper free with order. Unfortunately the printer arrived with 5 sheets of A3 paper and when I contacted I was told the A2 paper was out of stock and would be sent when back in stock. Two weeks later I still had no paper and after some negotiation I was sent 25 sheets of an alternative fine art paper a few days later. Some communication at the start would have been nice to let me know why the printer arrived without the paper. It also took significantly longer than they said to get paper which is why I requested an alternative paper.,2023-11-28T00:00:00Z,2023-12-09T18:46:22Z,3,Darrel Jones,,8

"Wex great as always, light stand less so!","Wex themselves are great as always, however the Calumet air cushioned stand is quite poor and not up to the standard of Calumet stands I've owned previously. The air cushion action is poor - sections of the stand drop quite quickly once released and don't 'brake' as they should, which doesn't instil me with confidence in them. The cushion action kicks in once it's dropped about two-thirds of the way down, but even then it's not smooth. Also, one section of the stand need to be over-tightened to stop if slipping. it's still a usable stand but it's not a pleasure to use and I wouldn't buy this one again. Manfrotto is far superior on this occasion, but of course you do pay for it!",2023-11-07T00:00:00Z,2023-11-14T21:15:47Z,3,Guy Parker,,7

"Not perfect this time, but I'd still recommend Wex","When my order of an Olympus 20mm lens arrived the expected lens hood wasn't in the box, and also the lens body cap was branded Lumix rather than Olympus. The box had clearly been opened at some point and I was concerned I might have been sent a used item in error. 
When I contacted Wex I would have been offered an immediate replacement but the lens was no longer in stock and quick timing was important as I wanted to use a cashback offer before it expired. I was offered a discount to cover the costs of replacing the lens hood and body cap, which I accepted. If I find there is any problem with the lens, Wex have a generous return period, so that has reassured me.
I really like Wex and have never had any problems before. I know mistakes can happen and staff were helpful and efficient in sorting out the problem. So I will definitely still use Wex, and remain very happy to recommend them. But it was only honest to rate this buying experience below the normal 5-star rating I would give them.",2023-11-02T00:00:00Z,2023-11-08T18:11:38Z,3,Andy Reynolds,,17

Issue With Trade-In Service - Resolved In The End,"I sent a lens to Wex to trade-in for cash. Upon receipt they claimed I had not included the lens hood and reduced their offer by nearly £100. Fortunately I had taken photos and video as I had parcelled the lens up for shipping to document its condition, so I can prove the hood was included. Hopefully this was an innocent mistake on Wex's part and not an attempted bait-and-switch on the price. I will update once I hear back from Wex, however even if they do reinstate their original offer, if you do choose to trade-in with them I'd recommend thoroughly documenting everything before doing so as you could be left short changed for their mistake.

Update:
Wex confirmed it was a mistake, and apologised. They reinstated their original offer with £20 compensation for the hassle.",2023-10-17T00:00:00Z,2023-10-17T19:21:30Z,3,Ben,,3

"Wex. Good company, shame about the delivery.","Wex, as usual, are fine. Good prices, good descriptions and grading.

Pity about ParcelForce as a delivery firm.
ParcelForce app told me the day they would deliver. App then said that they had tried to deliver and put a card through the door. Not true. I stayed in all day, no one came and there was no card. They tried delivery the next day when I was at home but in the garden. Missed them but got the card they ""forgot"" to put through the letter box the day before.

I have ordered a re-delivery. As they only attempt delivery twice why are they offering a ""third"" delivery.

I shouldn't sound ungrateful because over £50 the delivery is free from Wex. This isn't the first time this has happened. It won't happen again. In future I will pick up from Wex. Won't be using free delivery.

Hopefully I will get my lens on Wednesday, 12 or more days after the first ""delivery"". I couldn't arrange sooner because I couldn't guarantee I would be in all day. My neighbours work. £1.00 to deliver to the local post office half a mile away. I will probably kick myself that I didn't pay the £1 and didn't get the lens.

ADDENDUM
Wex contacted me re my post. Very apologetic. Not ACTUALLY their fault except for their choice of carrier.They say they are actively looking to change providers. 
Good customer service. They care if a customer is disappointed.

I eventually got my lens. I should also add that the Parcel Force driver is a really nice, cheerful guy. I've met him several times from previous Wex and non-Wex deliveries. No point in complaining to him, it's beyond his control. He just does HIS job the best he possibly can.",2023-08-28T00:00:00Z,2023-09-11T23:26:22Z,3,Stephen,,9

A bit disappointing.,"My first, I believe, less than 5 star review for Wex.

My most recent purchase proceeded following advice from Wex on the compatibility between a battery and a charger from an earlier version of that camera... the information I was given indicated the two were compatible but on receipt of the camera its battery would not even fit into the earlier charger.

I immediately emailed the staff member who had given me the inaccurate information but have not received a response... Wex are, in fairness, pretty fast with responses and there may well be good reasons for the delay.

Delivery is your Achilles’ heel,"Delivery is your Achilles’ heel. It is almast always hit and miss. It is not worth paying extra for next delivery since it does not get delivered on time. Goods are simply abandoned with anyone able to do a squiggle of signature on a rushed delivery drives ipad and no care is given to delivering the item to the actual customer. Your customer care also seems to be pressurised and rushed adding to my lack of satisfaction. I have been WEX customer, Calumet before for many years.

"Fast delivery, stock issue, no apology.","This time round I ordered a lens and filter. The lens was in stock, the order confirmation said the filter was on back-order. Odd, so why was it available for purchase as 'in stock'? I called WEX the following morning, a grumpy girl answered, messed around with her headset for a while so there was no conversation for about 20 seconds. She made no apology and couldn't be less interested in the fact they'd messed me around.

Mixed feelings about my purchase.,"I must admit that I have mixed feelings about my purchase. 
Good points:
1. Very safely packaged - excellent.
2. Good camera - I do like it.
Bad points:
1. The website says about used equipment ""Fully checked, cleaned & tested by our team of experts"".
The website description of the camera did indicate there was debris and marks to the body, which was a fair appraisal. However, on the camera's arrival the camera felt sticky - not due to any coating that was failing  - it was just dirty! I spent about 10 minutes cleaning the body carefully to remove the aforementioned debris and marks and it has come up really well. It wasn't that difficult for me to do. To be honest I do not think there was any attempt to clean the body of the camera and as such it makes a mockery of the website statement that all equipment is cleaned by experts. At least the internals i.e. the sensor etc. were fine.",2023-08-17T00:00:00Z,2023-08-29T13:55:06Z,3,Ray,,21

Poor delivery.,"I recently engaged with WEX regarding part exchange of some cameras and lenses. I was extremely pleased with the response and the customer interaction. However, I was disappointed with the delivery arrangements for my recent order. I ordered a lens, lens case, UV filter and a polarised filter. I received the lens case 4 days before the lens and when I contacted WEX regarding the filters I am informed they accompanied the lens. When I suggested they were missing I was informed that this could not be. 
When I was told it would take at least 4 days to resend the items, upon a request I did receive a refund and purchased the filters online and received them within 24 hours.
I want WEX to succeed and be my first choice supplier, their personal service is exceptional however, if poor delivery becomes the norm then I must seek an alternative.",2023-08-09T00:00:00Z,2023-08-16T14:01:05Z,3,Roy Pearson,,7
Failed to deliver in time,"Update: Updating the review to note the quality of the reply from Wex, both below and in private. Obviously it would be nice to see a more reliable next day service, but as long as the order isn't urgent I'd very happily choose to use Wex.

Ordered some gear I needed for a wedding at short notice so paid for next day delivery. After waiting in all the next day I received a message at 6.30pm to let me know that the Parcelforce driver went home at 5.30pm.

So I ordered from Amazon instead that evening and they had it with me by 11am the next morning. I like to support alternatives to Amazon but in this instance I needed a reliability that Wex were unable to offer.

I wanted the telescope delivered on…,"I wanted the telescope delivered on Saturday and the website declares this can be done by choosing Saturday at checkout and paying an extra fee. I couldn't find an option for Saturday delivery on the website. To keep things moving I checked out with normal delivery. This was to be the following Monday.

All I got in return was an automated email informing me that it would be delivered on the Monday. Monday came and went and no telescope or reason. Eventually I received a message it would be with us on Tuesday.

A long drawn out process.,"I have been a customer of WEX since 2014 and have always been satisfied with their service. This I believe is the first time I have sold equipment to them and I found the whole process very drawn out. My equipment was collected on the 17th and was delivered to WEX on the 19th where I received an email telling me so and that my equipment would take 4-6 days to be inspected. On Tuesday the 25th I emailed WEX asking when my equipment would be inspected, I got an email about an hour later saying it had been inspected and that if I wish to go ahead and they would send a secure link I then replied to this email  and still no link. I then received 2 further emails asking me if wanted proceed then reply to the email. I rang up WEX and stated that I had already replied and was told it takes 1 working day to send the link. I waited another hour and sent another email which was answered by Callum which included the link. Why could the link have been sent when I previously answered their emails. So but the time I will eventually get my funds it will be 10 days, far too long compared with another company who I have sold to in the past but WEX offered me a slightly better price but what a hassle. WEX needs to speed things up a little they state they want your equipment but when you send it its a long drawn our process unless they wake up I don't think I would sell to them again. There selling is far better than their Part Ex that's for sure, I'll certainly buy from them again but not Sell unless they speed things up.",2023-07-25T00:00:00Z,2023-07-25T17:36:15Z,3,Alan Smyth,,75

Used Nikon 200-500mm f5.6E ED VR,"The lens was sold as grade +9 (mint) but although it looked in fine condition, there was a problem with not being able to autofocus at the 500mm end, hunting and unable to lock onto a subject. Also at all range settings the camera data read 290mm.
Wex's initial response was for me to send it to Nikon for a firmware update. After much time consuming emailing and research I found it was a later model and didn't need the update and the firmware fix didn't relate to my issues anyway.
It was then agreed to send it back to Wex and on for repair at Fixation. 
Personally I was disappointed and surprised to receive the lens in this condition from Wex, it didn't give me a great deal of confidence in quite an expensive purchase. 
I'm very pleased however that Fixation managed to get it repaired and back to me in under 3 weeks and even more happy that they have given it a thorough inspection.",2023-05-01T23:00:00Z,2023-06-13T14:22:29Z,3,John Powell,,1

"Unacceptable Experience: Broken Gear, Double Charges, and Trade-In Denial.","I recently had the unfortunate experience of purchasing a camera and trading in my lens with WEX, and I must say, it has been an absolute nightmare. From start to finish, everything that could go wrong did, leaving me infuriated and extremely dissatisfied.

Let's start with the camera itself. Upon receiving it, I discovered a broken XQD card piece jammed deep within the card slot. I had to painstakingly fish it out, risking further damage to the camera. This is absolutely unacceptable! WEX should have thoroughly inspected the equipment before sending it out, ensuring that it was in proper working condition.

To make matters worse, I was charged TWICE for the camera body! Yes, you read that right. WEX had the audacity to drain my bank account with a duplicate charge, leaving me unable to access my funds for a whopping five days! This kind of financial inconvenience is simply unforgivable and demonstrates a severe lack of competence on their part. I expect better from a supposedly reputable company.

Moving on to the delivery process, it took a painstakingly long six days for my order to arrive. While I understand that delays can happen, this was far from ideal. I had high hopes for a prompt delivery, especially considering the significant amount of money I spent on this purchase. WEX needs to seriously reconsider their logistics and ensure that customers receive their orders in a timely manner.

As if all of this wasn't enough, WEX denied my lens trade-in! This means that not only am I left waiting for the return of my camera, but now I have to endure an additional delay for the lens as well. It's utterly frustrating and a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, my experience with WEX has been an absolute nightmare. The broken XQD card piece, the double charges, the delayed delivery, and the denied lens trade-in have left me seething with anger and disappointment. I would strongly advise anyone considering purchasing from WEX to think twice and explore alternative options. Their lack of attention to detail, customer service, and overall professionalism is simply inexcusable. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for your camera needs.

Edit: After posting my initial review, I want to provide an update on my experience with WEX. I received my purchased camera from them, and although it had significant dust on the sensor, William offered to replace it with a mint-condition camera. I took his offer, and I must say, the mint-condition camera is fantastic with a shutter count of <4000! I have tested this mint-condition unit thoroughly and have had absolutely zero issues with it. Additionally, I was offered a significant goodwill voucher as compensation. I am very pleased with the customer service provided by William after the initial review and how quickly, efficiently, and professionally solved my issues.",2023-05-25T00:00:00Z,2023-05-31T15:46:27Z,3,Luke McCabe,,1

Bizzare and inconsiderate Customer Service,"WEX had two lenses advertised on their website in the used section, one advertised as ‘open box’, the other ‘used’, the latter description stated it only had the slightest signs of use, including a small area of paint loss to the body, near the rubber focus ring. 

£80 separated the price of the two lenses, so I selected the more expensive ‘open box’ one and paid the extra £80.

The lens arrived and I immediately noticed the small area of paint loss to the body, near the rubber focus ring; this and some other signs of use made it evident that I’d been sent the Used lens instead of the ‘Open Box’ lens, that I’d paid the extra for.

I contacted WEX via email, confident that having spent nearly £1000, they’d resolve the situation promptly and efficiently.

After two days they got back to me and assured me that it was very unlikely that the wrong lens had been sent out. To prove it, I was confidently provided with the serial number of the lens that I should have received.

I pointed out that the serial number that they had provided was not the same as that on the lens I’d received, even the box had the wrong serial number on it.

Still confident, that this unfortunate (and very inconvenient) error would be resolved, I was shocked to receive a ‘take it or leave it’ response: Accept the Used lens and £50 off the price I’d paid for the more expensive ‘Open Box’ lens (meaning I pay £30 more than the price they’d originally advertised the Used lens for) or, we send a courier to pick it up.

Dear WEX, if you really care about your customers, and wish to retain and appreciate their loyalty, this is the kind of response a customer would have reasonably expected to have received in such circumstances: “don’t worry, it’s our mistake; we’ll sort this out for you.. when did you need the lens by? We’ll arrange for a courier to deliver the lens that you paid for, and at the same time they will collect the ‘used’ lens that we mistakenly sent to you”.

Mistakes happen, and Companies show their true colours by the lengths they’ll go to resolve a problem. 

In this case, it didn’t need much effort to maintain the loyalty of this particular customer, but bizarrely WEX chose to ‘add insult to injury’.

REVIEW UPDATE:

Wex contacted me promptly on the Saturday morning with a proposal to resolve the situation. Had it not been for the fact that it was a weekend and I had plans which required the use of lens, I’d probably have declined.

Since it was the printer I had ordered, this didn't make sense, and I immediately asked for Wex to send the printer asap (before it went out of stock again, as things are prone to do in this post Covid world) ... but I should not have had to check, and find it was in stock, I should have been notified as soon as it was available to be delivered ..",2023-04-21T00:00:00Z,2023-04-27T10:09:28Z,3,Peter Ashworth,,12

I used to like Wex a lot but they let me down badly on a previous order. Strangely, they didn’t ask for feedback then! I use them now when they have what I need at the right price but they’re no longer my first choice. For information, they held back a next day delivery of a printer for the sake of a freebie paper sample.

One further update. Unfortunately I spoke to a guy called Jonathan with a view to getting another item sent out. I won't be getting anything from this company. I gave them a chance but this guy was kind of rude. Not for me.

Agreed he was also quite rude in his manner as well as what was said. I can see your a fair company but obviously there are some issues. All the operative needed to say was I'm sorry for your experience if you give me your phone number I can make sure it won't happen again. I would then have put in the order for the item I wanted.

One issue I do have though is that the product box (not the transit box) had signs of being previously opened and the instruction leaflet was crumpled. Was this really brand new? was it a previously returned item that I've purchased?

They did take the money immediately as shown on my card site but it was refunded almost immediately. This did prevent me from using my card for several days, rather embarrassing. Otherwise, I have no complaints and will use them again.",2022-09-26T00:00:00Z,2022-10-01T17:26:04Z,3,John Pierce,,6

Excitement fading to despair and disappointment,"Decided it would be amazing to upgrade our DSLR cameras to the amazing Canon R6’s but this is turning into a nightmare, and to be absolutely clear, if any more issues and it is very likely we will cancel over £6000 worth of cameras/ lenses and accessories and take our business elsewhere.

THE GOOD
Really positive in store experience at Wex Bristol, got to touch and use the R6, even bringing home a couple of images to view them on the PC.
Explained we absolutely need the transaction to be seamless, as soon as the cameras were available we wanted to trade in our old DSLR cameras and lenses, and finance the remaining balance, assured that the trade in was the biggest hurdle, but if we let them know when we would come in we could get equipment valued and while there might be a need for us to go and get a coffee for a few hours , it could be done. Otherwise, it would take up to 48hrs if we left the trade in with them.
On that basis we placed an order for 2 cameras 3 lenses and spare batteries and an adaptor, total value over £6000 worth of new shiny and exciting kit 11/06/22
Big tick

THE BAD
The cameras showed in stock on the website, excitedly we contacted Wex Bristol, but they were really unwilling to give us much assurance when they were due to receive our cameras, that aside I trusted that they would arrive in store soon and made a special trip on 20/06/22 to the store to drop off the trade in items, I was then assured that due to the amount items that this could take 48hrs to get the valuations done
R6 Cameras in store 21/6/22
Not quite a tick but ok, except one major issue that is in the ugly section 

THE UGLY
Dropped off trade in items on Monday 20th June, 
One of the trade in DSLR bodies has not been put on the itemised list, the lens that is attached is but not the body, concerned that this may get lost as I have no record of Wex taking possession of it. 
Wednesday 22nd June, we were surprised to receive an email from the part exchange team based in Norwich, acknowledging the receipt of our equipment and that it could take up to 3 day to complete.
Apparently, items had been incorrectly flagged and therefore sent to Norwich. The manager at Wex Bristol has replied to our concerns and said that they should have been valued in store.
Friday morning 24th June, still no valuation.

From my perspective, this is way short of expectations and hugely disappointing, errors have been made that are of great concern.
I sincerely hope this will not turn to remorse for choosing Wex for this transaction.

Update .......
Delighted to say that Steve the store manager and Wex in general have made things happen.
Inevitably things do not always go to plan, how this is dealt with is what matters.
Following a trip to the store most issues have been fully addressed, it is worth noting, the camera body did safely make it to the east coast, the yet to be resolved issues have actions against them and importantly for me, we now have our new kit.

You provide 5 star service in all respects apart from final delivery where you are let down by your chosen partner  Parcel Force , hence I have given you only 3 stars . In 2022  a delivery company should be able to offer delivery slots of around an hour but not Parcel Force who make you wait in all day by saying the product will be delivered between 9am and 6pm . That is hopeless and unnecessary as their competitors demonstrate , also my last but one delivery from you was crushed and the lens inside only survived due to your excellent packing .

My order was allocated to someone else,My purchase was a pre-order for a new camera so I knew the delivery time would be long. It finally came into stock just before I was going on holiday and so Wex said they would hold my allocated stock for me to pay and arrange delivery when I was back. When I called them to arrange delivery they had re-allocated the camera to someone else and I was then in for what turned out to be another month waiting for stock to come in again. To be fair they apologised and gave some money off as an apology but their stock control was not good on this occasion. I do trust Wex though as a company and yes I will continue as a customer,,2022-06-08T20:12:10Z,3,Geoffrey Murphy,,4
Overall I am pleased but....,"Overall I am pleased but....
The lens arrived with a non original lens cap, the type that pinches from the outside meaning you can't remove the hood without taking off the cap. This is only a minor niggle, but I wouldn't have bought it if I had known. This is a bit disappointing especially when the lens is described as excellent and priced accordingly. I have had to order this at additional cost from OM Digital. I was told that Wex just sell whatever the person trading in supplied them, as though it's not important whether parts are original or not. Just one to be aware of if you are ordering used from Wex. 
The delivery was also quite slow, partly due to parcelforce not being able to find my address, which meant I missed out on taking the lens on a trip.
It is a very good lens and I would recommend it. I would give 5 stars for the lens alone.",,2022-06-07T22:44:30Z,3,TimClark,,2

Accepting their was nothing I could do I opened the package to inspect the Lens, a Sigma 105mm F2.8 EX DG MACRO OS. It's box was also damaged. Put the lens on my camera body and went and took a few snaps, the lens was noisy, to the extent I drove to Wex the next day to talk to someone about it. After trying another lens on my camera it was apparent that these lenses are noisy from the factory, all to do with the Optimised Stabiliser apparantly, so I was happy it was not just me who received a crappy lens, apparently this model are all crappy.

* *UPDATE**
I would like to add that the staff at WEX were more than helpful in all aspects of my problem. I have used the lens a lot over the last few days, the noisiness, in my opinion has gotten a little less and the pictures are still pin sharp which I am happy about.

I knew exactly what lens I was after so I had to go and find someone to assist, a young lad who had no customer skills at all looked on their database and indicated they had one in stock with a Nikon Fit. At no point was there any interest in asking what my intended use was, perhaps offering an alternative or providing information. Also made no effort to run through the spec of the lens, didn't know if it came with a case, I wanted a Nikon fit but was offered a Canon body to view it. 
I had to open the box on the counter prior to paying to find out, and check the lens over myself.

Unfortunately, they let themselves down by using Parcelfarce to deliver.  They, as is their tradition in our experience, failed to deliver on the agreed date or the following day but on the third day with a slightly torn box. Because of Wex packing the contents were undamaged.  Hence the actual grading.

There's alway a 'However', isn't there?'

My issue relates to one of your staff who went by the name of Ben. I think he is a sales manager or sales director - something like that.
I emailed him with 2 specific questions. He ignored one of them and was determinedly vague about the other one. I have a little retail experience and i was always told not to bring my problems to work. I don't know if this is what happened to Ben but i honestly felt i was getting in the way of something else. 
I ended up emailing him again and what I got was 'Yeah'. I still don't have an answer to either question. It's true what people say -- People forget the good service and never forget the bad!

Now, perhaps you could at least tell me - When will the missing part of my order for a rangcam 2 be back in stock. To say around the middle of the month is far from adequate!

Multiple collection and delivery issues,"Multiple issues with this order. Should have been a simple case of picking up the camera from the warehouse when notified it was ready followed by delivery of the two out of stock items. Instead there was no notification of it’s readiness but took a phone call from me to learn that the item was sitting in wait for collection. Then of the two remaining items one was ‘returned’ and credited back to me after never even being despatched, and took another phone call and payment in order to be ‘re-sent’ and still took 2 weeks to be received, while the other arrived unannounced without warning of despatch. I was given a small discount and credit voucher (though that requires placing another order). What a mess.",,2022-01-21T04:49:06Z,3,Gary Craggs,,9

Disappointed.... Standards have fallen...,"This is the 9th or 10th time I have ordered from Wex in the past 8 years, all my major camera purchases have been from here and I have been delighted but this time was different. I placed an order for a major camera upgrade and spent over £3500 which is a lot of money to me anyway. The order went through got an email and a notification, a day later it was processed and dispatched but no tracking number but I thought to my self they just missed it on the email. After a 3 days, still no tracking and no camera so I contacted live chat and asked for a tracking number the guy on the other end told me he would email it. Waited all day no email, asked again and he apologised and said he would get it sorted. 4 days later due to new year weekend still no email so I phoned and after 20 mins on the phone I was informed there was an issue with the order and their system was the problem, they hoped to have it fixed that day by their IT team. So the camera had not left WEX yet. Imagine if I hadn't have phoned.... Would it still be in limbo? It took them a further 3 days to dispatch the product but at least they sent me regular updates after I complained about the poor communication. Finally 10 days after order was placed, it was dispatched with a tracking number however they now use FEDEX (just read the reviews). FEDEX tracking stated they needed 5 days to get me my parcel from one UK location to another WHY? Amazon can be here in a day, DPD 2 days. Now it didn't end there as I said they used FEDEX and they couldn't actually make there promised delivery schedule and it finally arrive a day late. Oh did anyone contact me from FEDEX or WEX..... NO..  So overall really poor this time WEX, your standards have slipped and you now use one of what seems like the poorest couriers in the UK.. *UPDATE* nice to see WEX caring about my issues and the apology was much appreciated... I always say you see the true side of a business when you have an issue.",,2022-01-12T20:37:53Z,3,Lee,,2
Good Service but Cash-Back Problems,"If this was about the ordering and delivery alone, I would give 5 stars but I have become embroiled in a dispute over a cash-back offer. When I ordered the printer it was subject to a double cash-back offer. The printer was out of stock but the Wex website said that retrospective claims would be honoured, as long as the order date was in the appropriate window. The printer eventually arrived and I went to claim the cash-back but the Epson website would not accept a retrospective claim. Wex sales were very helpful and between them and Epson I was able to submit a claim. However, when it was processed it was only for the current single cash-back amount, not the double cash-back offer that was in place when I ordered it.
I await Wex/Epson resolution but it has made a good purchase experience feeling like I was duped.",,2022-01-12T09:17:01Z,3,Mr Stephen Hartley,,54

Be wary when trading in,"Had a disagreement over condition of a trade-in camera with their ‘inspector’ citing cosmetic damage that I had not seen despite a close visual inspection prior to sending. They downgraded the first quote, although they upped it a bit after being challenged (to the extent where it was more hassle than it was worth to have the item returned and start again). However, it left a bad taste. To be fair, I’ve used them before and they’ve been good. For that reason, I’d been a bit more trusting so I wasn’t in the habit of keeping a photographic record of an item’s condition before sending it. However, this is a lesson learned and I will be more wary in future just in case this is a sign of a more aggressive approach to bargaining.",,2022-01-08T11:16:15Z,3,Doug MacBane,,3

Positive for Wex was the manner in which issue was handled, they have ordered a new lens replacement, although no stock at present and no due date.

Delivery problem,"I bought Capture One over the Black Friday weekend. I spoke to Wex staff and they were very helpful as usual and I got a great deal. The reason for the 3* review was because after a week I hadn't received anything. Because the order mentioned delivery, I assumed i'd receive a DVD and because I'd bought it at the end of the busy weekend, I gave them a week before contacting them. When I contacted them, the staff were again very helpful and explained that all is receive was an email with the license code. This they promised to chase up and it arrived within an hour. So, overall, whilst my experience was great and their staff couldn't have been more helpful, why wasn't the email sent promptly and when would it have been sent had I not chased them up?",,2021-12-13T07:53:34Z,3,Richard Rees,,13

It's their packing that lets them down. They do this on the cheap and so things get put into bubble envelopes and sent by Royal Mail which is not good enough for delicate items (and for what I've paid for them). Many a time I have received items from Wex with the internal manufacturers packing crushed - not damn good enough. God knows, I've had stuff from eBay under £20 sent by Hermes couriers.

It took sometime to work out what the status of this printer was.  The Canon manual/instructions didn't help as the instruction were listed as G2060 rather than G2560 and an error code 1366 was listed online but with no link or instructions.  Appalling.

I eventually worked out what to do and link it to my PC (that bit WAS easy) but it was not what I expected.

It may have been OK had WEX provided a brief resume of the status of the printer so I knew what had been done and what else was needed.

Wex's poor service,"I was in London at the weekend and traveled to Wex with the intention of buying the Sony RX 10 Mk4. A beautiful shop, easy to get to on the buses. When my wife and I walked in though we were totally ignored, they were too busy putting out stock and cleaning. Even a good morning or Hello would have gone a long way welcome us. Needless to say we didn't stay long and I took my business elsewhere. Your loss Wex.",,2021-06-23T15:37:08Z,3,Steve Wright,,29

Mixed experience,"Great camera & received my access for capture one very quickly. 
A couple of issues around delivery. I selected Sunday delivery and paid extra for it. Mid afternoon Sunday when it hadn’t arrived I messaged via email & Facebook. I got a response on Facebook saying due to website maintenance I couldn’t have that Sunday & I had picked next Sunday. 
I’m 100% sure I had picked the Sunday in question & rather than apologise or offer alternatives the person I spoke to on Facebook basically said it wasn’t possible & then stopped replying to me. 
I had to chase it up again on the Monday to again basically be called a liar. 
Perhaps the website maintenance was the reason I could select a date & it didn’t come through right? 
Luckily Martin who responded to my email was very pleasant & apologised for my inconvenience (all that was required, but not received via Facebook). 
I requested for my camera to be delivered Wednesday instead when I would be home, but it was delivered Tuesday & left in a box outside my house all day. 
Luckily we live in a quiet area and it wasn’t wet, but that was £2000 worth of stuff & good job it was the right address. 

On the positives it was well packaged. 
I think some (not all) of the customer service has probably put me off ordering again though sadly.",,2021-05-23T07:28:29Z,3,Lauren ,,1
The issue is their new system being very buggy,"There a lot of issues in their new system so I would avoid the company till these issues are sorted.

I ordered an item and received the wrong one.

I had to wait a few days before this could be addressed as the system was being swapped over and no customer service agents could get to the information.

Once it had switched over the was a large number of mistakes happening through the new system.

Firstly none of the previous messages were passed on properly so it meant having to start again each time.

When it was finally sorted to have the item picked up after being told the actual item was in stock I phoned on the day to check it was going ahead and was told they were picking it up from an address at the other end of the country.

This is what it was displaying on the system.

An hour later it gets picked up from my correct address but they are asking for two packages.

I get called about the new pickup being the next day to then tell them it had just been picked up although they were asking for two packages.

They said that they weren't sure why this happened and said they would cancel the new pick-up and did this over the phone to tell me it was done.

Then later on I get called to be told the item that was meant to be sent to me after asking for the item to be put on hold for me was told to now be out of stock.

The next day I had another driver looking for two pacakeges.

Then the next day I get notified it was returned and a full refund was given.

This is the experience so far... hopefully I get sent the refund of what I paid not a refund for the wrong item they sent... the really weird thing is the model they sent isn't even a model available on their website.

The staff is good in the company and I'm sure the company is good.

They're a big issue with their system at the moment and should avoid using them till it is fixed.

The company should maybe announce it on the website and then let people know when the system is sorted and running smoothly.",,2021-05-21T10:32:17Z,3,Liam Hebden,,3
Disappointing recent service,"Firstly I have to say I have received excellent service from Wex in the past and sometimes exemplary service.  I also acknowledge that they have been working in extremely difficult circumstances over the past year.  This review is born out of a frustration with misinformation and inflexibility.
I have recently had an interest in purchasing a Laowa lens and in order to part fund it sent a lens for assessment. Last Friday I hadn't heard the result of the assessment and in order to make sure the lens I wanted was in stock I contacted Wex on the chat line.  I was assured there was plenty of stock and there was no reason to reserve one.
I had the result of the assessment on Saturday and on Sunday decided to place an order, unfortunately I could not use my credit as the IT system was under maintenance.
There was a slight confusion about which version of the lens to buy and I had an excellent conversation with Billy on Monday but the version I decided on was now out of stock.  Further information revealed that in fact the other version was more suitable so on Tuesday I decided to order that one but that too had gone out of stock.
In frustration I emailed customer services who, in one part of the website say replies within 2 hours and in another 2 days, so far no reply.
Other suppliers have this lens in stock but of course part of the finance for it resides as credit and I cannot retrieve it as cash.  I have now placed reserve orders for each version to keep my options open but as  a result of the misinformation and the system used to trade in I am without the lens I wanted with no idea when it will return to stock.

Update
I have received the reply below which acknowledges the error and frustration caused and I can ask no more than that, restoring my faith in Wex customer service. The price adjustment is an unexpected bonus.",,2021-05-20T17:15:19Z,3,Stuart Carlton,,9

It was only after that they let me know that it was out of stock!  I would be informed when it was available.

Selling items not in stock,"Editing due to response from Wex. Can't remember spotting the awaiting order status, but accept that this could of been an error on my part. And would not like to negitivly impact a business due to an inaccurate review. 

I ordered a Camera body and lens package on the Wex website. After the purchase I got a sales confirmation email, which included a message saying the item was not in stock, with no real clarity on when the product will be back in stock. I am disappointed that there was no indication the item was not in stock prior to confirming the order. I feel companies should not sell items they don't have without making it very clear during the sales process. I also feel that a curtesy communication from them explaining the delay and offering a option to cancel would of been standard customer service.  I have also just come off the phone with them where I was told they hope to have a delivery mid April so I should receive the order some time after that. Again there was not offer of an apology for the delay or a offer to cancel the order. I plan to cancel the order and would think twice about using this company in the future.",,2021-04-10T13:17:48Z,3,rich,,5

I added next day delivery only to the receive an email telling me that no product would be sent until both are in stock.. why offer next day delivery then? 
I called and spoke to someone to arrange collection from their store the next day which was fine, and the order was split. I turned up the following day to collect my order and due to covid had to call the shop and wait outside (totally understandable) I waited and a chap brought down my new product and handed it over, didn’t say a word, didn’t say thank you, and after spending the best part of £1500 I would have expected better customer service or at least some form of acknowledgment.

I also received fair valuations for my trade in items.

However this time around I have take one star off as I have noticed that Wex's price for the item I purchased last is about 20% higher from Amazon's which is odd as Wex have been super competitive with their prices in my previous purchases (and I would never purchase high value photographic equipment from Amazon anyways, I prefer to support real stores but 20% is still quite a noticeable gap.)

Not up to usual Wex standards.,"I usually rate Wex 5 stars but was not so happy with my latest experience.
I purchased an Eizo monitor and took the opportunity to buy an 'Open Box' item at reduced price. I understood this would be an item that had been unpacked and tried out but not used and assumed that the monitor would come with all the accessories. When I unpacked this I found that all but one of the cables, the user guide, the CD for the software and a cable clip were all missing.
It is possible that, an exact list of the contents was included somewhere in the detailed information and that I missed this. I was unable to check once I had received the item. However, I feel that it should be made clear somewhere very obvious on the screen if an item does not contain all the relevant accessories.
Repacking the monitor was tricky, as the extendable column for the base got stuck and it was necessary to detach this and pack it separately.
I was pleased that Wex did arrange and pay for collection of the monitor and have made a speedy refund. Thank you for that.",,2021-03-02T10:21:32Z,3,Customer,,11

More joined up thinking required.,"More joined up thinking required.
These are difficult times and most staff are working from home, so inter communication isn't easy..HOWEVER: I was attempting to trade in one camera for a new one and it seems px, sales, repairs and customer services are separate departments who don't appear to talk to each other that much. Correspondingly I eventually received a quote for a top line camera with a minor fault that left me with a trade in value of £100 for a camera originally costing  £2k just 4 years ago. This was bordering on the insulting and eventually a better offer was made, which I still declined! However the px and customer service department were slow on the uptake and it took over a month before I actually received my new camera body. I'm still waiting for the old camera to be repaired after 8 weeks. This company, when we were allowed to actually visit them, were fantatsic but things have changed I fear for the worst. I think attention to detail and realisitic understanding of their longstanding customers- I have bought 4 cameras from them- might be helpful. Meantime maybe when we can actually go there, I trust things might be better, I reserve judgement.

With respect to comment below from Wex- no one called me!!",,2021-01-11T12:26:01Z,3,CC,,1
Good item spoiled by Parcelforce delivery,"The light box is exactly as described, and fits my purpose. It seems well made and of good quality. Hence 3 stars. Delivery was rather different. Parcelforce advised delivery between 0716 and 0816 but didn't send the advice until 0825. The item did not arrive; at just after 0900 I was advised that delivery had been attempted  at 0858 and a card pushed through the door. CCTV confirmed both were untrue. After half a day trying to get answers from Parcelforce it emerged that the driver had been diverted to deliver Covid supplies (No problem) BUT they provided no explanation for the false claims made about delivery. Awaiting reply from MD at Parcelforce. This is wholly unsatisfactory and wasted a lot of several people's time. This item wasn't, but it could have been a very expensive piece of camera gear - so my strong personal advice would be: don't order anything that is carried by Parcelforce. Wex appears aware of Parcelforce issues but reluctant to deal with the problem. Wex engineered a refund for the postage costs - many thanks.

Frustrating!,"Just to put this gripe into perspective, I have been a loyal Wex customer for 14 years and until this week have always enjoyed outstanding customer service. I needed a new lens for a job and selected next day delivery. The lens was fine but the metal lens hood was damaged, I immediately called Wex and explained the problem. They said return the whole lens and hood and when they had received it back and checked it they would ship a replacement. No good I explained, as I NEEDED the lens for at least the rest of the week, ""could I not just send the lens hood back for replacement?"" - no, apparently I could not. This problem was left with them to resolve and as I had not received an update within 24 hours, I chased them again the following day. So, after quite a few minutes of the customer services person refusing to budge or make an exception to his rigid set of rules, and me having to express my frustrations in no uncertain terms, the issue was finally escalated to a manager wherupon they agreed to ship a replacement and delay the collection of the damaged lens so that the transition would be seemless. Perfect and appropriate outcome, why could you not have done this in the first place, saved me 30 minutes of frustrating phonecalls and unnecessary unpleasantness over such a simple issue.",,2021-01-08T14:52:10Z,3,Steven,,11

We're in Covid with people working from home but it took multiple calls to a different person every time before it was resolved. I subsequently ordered a camera from elsewhere and used Wex credit on a lens, so they lost business.  Next day and sat delivery wasn't- poor Parcel Force delivery. Packaging materials were poor twice, which I reported to them. The items I ordered from elsewhere arrived on time in good condition, well packaged and cheaper.

WEX itself great; ParcelForce delivery ....,"Hard to rate ...

The service from Wex itself, the range of available stock and the response to queries are all excellent.  Other companies may do as well but I find it hard to imagine anything actually better. 5 stars. 

What is very disappointing, though, is the continued use of ParcelForce for deliveries.  A very expensive item ordered on a Thursday with extra specifically paid for next day delivery should not arrive only on the following Monday.  

It would not be so bad if ParcelForce had a system like other companies such as DPD that allows properly effective tracking and notifications.  Also, I could see this as a one-off if it were not the second time (with Wex items) that it has happened. A late delivered item = time wasted waiting in for its non-arrival, overturned plans and considerable disappointment. 2- stars.

Note: on the day concerned, the Peterborough distribution centre was affected by poor weather but not the Hatfield centre where the parcel was kept for over three days.",,2020-12-10T09:33:46Z,3,RobW,,24

Think twice if you're not 100% sure of your purchase...,"Made a purchase (camera bag) which was delivered promptly and well packaged. However it was only on receipt that I realised it wasn't suited to what I was looking for and therefore would need to return - something that Wex advertise as being able to do for up to 30 days after purchase.

Unfortunately this is where the experience goes wrong. What I didn't realise it that, unlike a lot of companies these days, Wex do not offer free returns unless the item is faulty. To send back using the service they recommend has cost me over £25 - about a quarter of the original item cost. Once a return is initiated, they also state it must be received within two weeks - which adds a bit of pressure to get arranged quickly.

It is disappointing that a returns option, such as Collect+, isn't provided - for both convenience and cost - though I appreciate it was my error to assume there would be. 

So overall a mixed experience; prompt and efficient initial delivery but a bad returns experience. My advice: make sure you're fully sure of your purchase before you make it, otherwise you'll learn the hard way like me.",,2020-11-30T10:10:16Z,3,Philip,,3

First time I've used Wex Photo,"First time I've used Wex Photo. Purchased a used Olympus OMD EM5 Mk II, body only. I went for a better quality option as there were a couple of categories, ie.one with very little use and wear, looks almost new. The order went very well and was tracked with progress and all very good service. The box arrived, again all well packed and VGC. However on checking the contents all the leads were there but the battery charger body itself was missing, and also the clip on flash was missing but the bag it fits in was supplied. I phoned straight away and reported this to them. The initial answer was this is a used item and the description didn't say these items were included. I checked my email paperwork and copy of the order, it just has a one line description (ie. just camera model) with no mention of what is or isn't in the box. I explain that this is like selling a car without a petrol tank, I have no way to charge the battery, so pretty fundamental right! After minutes of waiting to check stock they say they will send me a charger, they actioned this same day and it arrives next day no problem. I didn't push for the flash gun, I didn't have any proof, but it should have been in there if the kit was complete as I had believed. This raises a huge problem with their system, there is no copy of what was advertised anywhere with the paperwork, and this vital information is not even on the website. So there is no proof of what they were selling available to you to check against or dispute. I told them this is a problem they need to fix, we'll see!! But if you buy anything used check the small print and take screen shots of the exact description and what it says is included, they probably won't tell you what is missing, which sucks to be honest. If you don't have screen shots of the as sold description you won't have a leg to stand on when complaining something is missing. A real shame because the service seems to be very good, just let down by their paperwork and descriptions. Beware!!",,2020-11-13T17:08:15Z,3,John Sutton,,14

Need better up-front info on appraisal process,"I sold camera and lens in original boxes, manuals and other accessories as originally purchased included. 

WEX initial offer was lower than MBP by £70, but they been happy to match the price. Process of organising pick-up of the parcel was easy, done through Parcel Force with next day pick-up and delivered following day. Technician test was done also fast in one day. 

However that is when surprises came. Given that camera and lens been import WEX down-prised them, no specific calculation given just inadequate comment ""well you did not pay same as sold in UK"". Camera had US charger so £40 been deducted also. 

Finally payment to my account was easy to organise and done on time.

In my opinion WEX should be little more upfront about  their appraisal process, especially price deduction of the product when imported. Deducting £40 from 7 years old camera when adapter is in the package, just different standard is questionable. WEX will for sure be able to sell camera no problems, either new owner is informed to buy adapter or they add one in the box, it cost 2-3 £ at the end of the day.",,2020-10-27T11:52:13Z,3,Peter,,3

Late Delivery,"I ordered a new filter and paid for Friday delivery but on the Thursday Parcel Force sent me a text saying the parcel was delayed and would not arrive on time. It stated Mon-Frid for delivery but I wanted to use the filter on the Monday morning.
I used the Wex Chat and he was sorry and  it would likely arrive on the Saturday ...and refunded my postage which was all great.
BUT filter did not arrive on Saturday or Sunday or even Monday...in fact it had been sitting in Perth Parcel Force office since Saturday morning when it could have been delivered.
I had to contact Wex again ....have had no reply but the filter did arrive on Tuesday.
Not up to the usually excellent customer service provided by Wex!",,2020-09-08T10:34:33Z,3,L Mitchell,,20
Trade in via Wex.,In the past I have always gone to Wex without considering any other supplier.   On the last occasion I found that they offered less for my kit than two competitors.   I then went to my local Wex and found that they would price match the new lens I wanted AFTER they had checked that kit was available in the competitor.   In future I will be much less trusting of Wex.,,2020-09-07T12:18:36Z,3,David Watts,,48
Very Average Service,"First monitor they delivered appeared to have missing parts.  When I reported back to Wex (expecting them to send me the missing parts) they said that a manufacturing defect might be the reason (?) and insisted that I send it back before they would deal with a replacement .  A replacement turned up about 8 days later (after I contacted them they appeared to suddenly realise that my account was in credit and I was due a new monitor). 
The replacement monitor had the same missing parts ! (apparently a software disk is not sent out (download from Eizo web site) and the cable in question is an extra.  
Very average issue resolution process.  Very average delivery service. Have not had such problems before but will think twice before ordering from Wex again

Addendum 06SEP20 (following reply from Wex):
I appreciate you taking the time to respond (surprising how many companies on here ask for feedback and then don't bother to respond).  I should add that the replacement I did receive contained a European schuko plug but not a UK one.  No problem I have plenty of spare power leads but once again surely someone should quality check these things before they are sent out?   The monitor is superb by the way so thank you to Eizo.",,2020-09-04T14:38:42Z,3,Stephen Hart,,113

An average experience,"Be careful when part exchanging as they tend to drop the value of your quote when they receive your equipment. Their sale prices do seem to be on the high side compared to some other major dealers. I part exchanged mainly for the convenience of not having to sell my equipment on eBay.

Mark, you are correct your colleague did apologise however there was more than one mistake. I was firstly informed you were dropping the price of my video camera as it had a 3rd party battery even though the original Panasonic battery was there and the other battery which was a Duracell one and was given to you gratis along with a charger and case which also didn’t come with the original kit which you sold me !
The mistake you refer to was the fact that you quoted a price for my dslr in the condition of “very little use” , you examined the camera and agreed it was in that condition but then proceeded to drop the price saying you had made a mistake. You decided to knock off £8 I think even though I had also given you UV and polarising filters free of charge as they were no longer of any use to me.",,2020-08-21T10:27:58Z,3,Peter ,,3

Add to that that Parcelforce just dumped the item on the doorstep and claimed it had been signed for.... Fortunately my son-in-law dealt with it. Item is OK, but hence the 3 stars. Mind you, Parcelforce wouldn't have rated 1 star.

The two weeks became three and I was told that the repairers were very busy.

The consequences were inevitable. Adding insult to injury they dropped the price of the head I'd just ordered by £100 pretty much immediately. I should have sent it back really and ordered another one!

I try to support independent camera shops whenever possible, but as I keep saying to Jessops, every damn time I place an order with you you find some way of making me regret it!

Sorry, but the moral of the story is, stick to Amazon.",,2020-06-02T08:31:08Z,3,Alex Carnes,,6

Delivery problems with 2 orders.,"Created 2 orders recently.
First order should have been dispatched on the same day but this didn't happen. I don't know if this was WEXs' fault or their carrier. The carrier then failed to deliver the order the day after they took possession of it.
The second order was dispatched OK and was picked up by the carrier on time. The carrier then failed to get it to the delivery depot on time. The next day the carrier gave a delivery time slot but failed to deliver ' due to a breakdown '. I await to see what happens tomorrow.
I would normally allocate 4 or 5 stars to WEX but I have cut my rating because of the delivery problems.",,2020-05-28T15:57:49Z,3,satisfied_customer,,7

My experience,"Update (as I got a reply from customer team): The gimbal got delivered on Monday (unfortunately, after the project finished, but I'll be using it in the future as well). I was surprised that the customer help team actually replied on Trustpilot and handled the issue promptly.  I will leave the rating as 3/5, as I just wish the item was delivered when the website said it would be and I wouldn't need to check the delivery updates every hour hoping it would get delivered and calling the order helpline (which only has automated messages)

I ordered an item that I needed urgently for filming with a promise of a 1-day delivery (for which I paid extra £5) that was supposed to be delivered on Friday. The item was cheaper (£20 cheaper) elsewhere, so the only reason I ordered from Wex is because of their fast delivery promise. However, nothing was delivered and their tracking number says that the item isn't even out for delivery. Parcelforce website says that only deliver Monday to Friday and Monday is a bank holiday, so I guess I can only expect the parcel next week - missing the deadline for my filming project. I tried to message and call Wex - just automated messages everywhere and no reply. They ruined my project, my plans and even charged £5 for a non-existent one-day delivery. Absolutely gutted.",,2020-05-23T12:13:09Z,3,Liz ,"London , GB",18

I gave it 3 stars because I was satisfied with the camera repair after the warranty.

Luckily I wasn't in a panic to receive the item. But had I known this before payment, I probably would ether, awaited their restocking, before making the purchase, or looked elsewhere.

After years of purchases now just a mail order supplier and indifferent to loyalty.,"Although I have used Wex for years I was recently disappointed with their lack of customer interaction. Waiting for a Canon 1Dx Mark 3 I asked for a used price on a 5D IV I had purchased from them 6 months before and still under warranty. When they didn’t offer as much as another retailer they asked for proof of that offer and then matched it. However when the 1Dx became available the used price had dropped and no one would discuss reinstating it; rather shortsighted I thought and certainly didn’t make me feel a valued customer. 
The other retailer honoured their original offer and the 1 Dx was purchased and collected. I now see Wex as simply a mail order supplier.",,2020-04-06T08:32:14Z,3,Alan HORTEN,,3

However, the item was posted on their Ebay page which asks for bids. The seller really ought to inform buyers that the items are on different channels for sale. This would have allowed me to make an offer and probably get a small if not slightly better deal. I mean every penny counts these days right?

So 5 out of 5 for web transaction. 2 from 5 for the lack of transparency with Ebay.

Service not as good as mpb.com,"My purchase was not quite what I expected, the lens was described as 9, and I’m sure the description said “ Original box, manual, hood, front and rear cap.”. Well it wasn’t in the original box, didn’t have a manual, and the front and rear caps weren’t, the originals. 

They also knocked £14 from the price they originally quoted, downgrading the lens I part exchanged from 9 to 9-, give the price I paid for the lens I bought, and the markup they have made on the lens I part exchanged (as it’s the only 9- Zeiss lens on the website) knocking £14 off I think was a trifle petty. 

I also paid for 24 hour tracked, the lens took 5 days to arrive, Wex’s excuse was the current C19 situation. If that was the case 24 hour tracked shouldn’t have been an option.

I base these comments as a comparison with the fantastic service I got from mpb.com at the same time when I used mpb to part exchange a lens.

The sales staff did not know of this offer could not get the code to work there computers against my email address .I actually sent them a copy of it in the end. After some considerable time hanging on the phone and them phoning back it had to be put through manually.In the end they gave next working day free delivery as abit of a sweetener .Perhaps the lesson to be learned make sure everybody knows what you are sending out ,this does not mean i will not purchase from them again .",,2019-12-06T11:18:54Z,3,Mr  Paul  Brander,,7

Slight attitude towards online returns...,"I have bought numerous photography products from Wex, from, high end lenses and tripods to smaller accessories, and the sales service has alway been efficient. 
However, for returns you have to ring them, and on the two occasions when I wanted to return relatively inexpensive items, (and always within a day or so of receipt), for the first I was given a bit of a grilling as to why I wanted to return it, which made me feel uncomfortable, and for the second item I had to chase up my refund, in fact I'm still waiting for it.  
I think Wex need to be reminded of online customers rights, if an item is returned clearly used then they should take it up with the customer then, not treat someone as though they're guilty until proven innocent. Better still they should have an online return facility without the need to call. 
I've just bought a lens from Amazon which was the same price as Wex, only so that I have a no quibble return if necessary and that's a shame as I believe in supporting camera stores rather than the multi globals, but not everyone lives near a major city where they can get a hands on try before you buy experience.",,2019-11-27T09:56:37Z,3,Julia Martin,,16
Delivery issues,I was led to believe the next day delivery was guaranteed. Only after waiting all day did I ring to find out that Royal Mail finish the delivery and so arrival is dependent on their schedules. There is no clear indication of this on the parcel force site.

I understand things aren’t always in stock however as with most people if this is clear it does effect your decision to buy from a particular retailer. 

One small gripe was the website allows you to pay for next day delivery even if a product isn’t available meaning I paid £4.99 for a fast delivery for the product to then not be available next day. I highlighted this with the person I spoke with and this was refunded however their system shouldn’t allow you to pay for something that they cannot offer. 

Product arrived 12 days after order and was as described and I’m very happy with it.

On 30 July I received an email from Parcelforce not Wex saying my parcel would be delivered between 11.45 and 12.45. This surprised me as I had asked for delivery to my local store not my home address. This of course meant I had to stay at home in the morning awaiting the delivery. Needless to say Parcelforce never did arrive with me wasting my whole day. On using Parcelforce tracking service, which was up and down like a yo-yo all day, imagine my surprise to find they had delivered it to me late afternoon signed by another person.

Delivery issues by their courier :-(,"Ordered tripod and century stand for a (paid for) Saturday delivery. The c-stand was for a shoot on the Sunday. Their courier (Parcelfarce) messaged me that it would arrive 1pm-2pm slot that morning. Never showed up. Courier tracking indicated that no attempt was made to deliver the items. They were back in their depot before 2 minutes before 2pm but then added an entry that they could not find my address at 2.40. Their depot is a substantial way from where I live so there is good evidence that they could not be bothered to deliver the items on a hot Saturday afternoon. Other reviews of Wex and ParcelFarce have similar stories of failed deliveries.

Contacted Wex on the failed delivery day and they undertook to cancel the package, but they failed to do so as will become apparent.

Two days later Parcelfarce gave the delivery to 'a neighbour' but it was actually dumped in an insecure open area, not only open to theft but also highlighting that someone who might have some nice photography equipment lived in the building.

Wex were contacted and gave the usual soundbites about being very sorry. Despite me being clear in my email that I work office hours Mon-Friday, they apparently sent ParcelFarce back to collect the parcel, as I found a card with no references number, just my name stuck under my door. 

I made a complaint about the failure to cancel the order after Parcelfarce had botched the original delivery.

Wex's use of a courier very well known for their poor reputation (just check out their Trustpilot ratings) caused the failed delivery. The initial failure was compounded by a second delivery (I specifically told them not to do) which ended up abandoned in a communal area.

Update

Since posting the review Wex has been in touch and, to be fair to them, they have now redressed the problem with the delivery by compensating me for the problems and refunded me the cost of delivery. As a result I have altered my initial review somewhat.

They have also informed me that they are reviewing the issues regarding the delivery with their courier.",,2019-07-04T23:40:02Z,3,Jim,,6
Great product range but clunky sales process,"I like Wex because they have a great range of products at competitive prices, and are a proper photographic supplier, not just a cut-price sales hub. However, it took me a while to find the lens I wanted using the search function; it seemed that they didn't have it, and I almost went elsewhere. Then there was a delay in delivery because one item was thought to be in stock but was a ""box opened"" item; this was promptly rectified when I telephoned, and the goods then arrived promptly in excellent condition. Finally, opportunity missed - after taking the delivery I discovered that the lens didn't come with its own carry pouch (unlike some manufacturers) so I had to order one separately - this time from the dreaded, worker-abusing, world-dominating cut price hub!",,2019-07-03T10:29:23Z,3,Cheminal,,8
Not joined up!,"So, I have used the Norwich branch on many occasions without issue. Dom at your Manchester Branch was very helpful and did everything he said he would do. My gripe is that you are now a big player in the Photo/Video retail sector in the UK but your systems for ordering appear corner shopish. For instance I wanted a Nikon 200-500mm lens. Norwich, who I normally deal with had no stock. Your internet page showed no stock. Your Birmingham and Manchester did have stock! I was informed that your telesales cannot order from these shops. They can only order from the Wex Warehouse stock and I would have to order it from the shop, which I did. It appears that you may be treating each outlet as an independent profit centre, which on this occasion could have lead to a no sale. I had to pursued the item myself as your telesales could not help. IMHO you need to get a joined up system or altered your process to take stock from where ever it is available to service the customer. So my 3 stars may appear harsh but may be some one should look at this as this is/was very frustrating.

fraud check after payment is a waste of time.,"Totally understand the fraud safety check but not letting customers know this information before putting through a purchase is unacceptable. Having the payment removed from your account before you've done the check should also not happen if it is indeed a check for fraud.  

An efficient system needs to be put in place for customers who are not ordering to their home address or address stated on their driving licence.  If you are travelling like in my own case and would like the item delivered to a temporary address, there should be an easier process other than having to call customer service and sit on the phone for a long time. 

My item did not arrive on time either. Honestly would not recommend Wex after this.

Inconsistent delivery dates between online & instore orders...,"I was needing the item prompt so I ordered in store thinking this would be the quickest having already noticed the delivery date online with them direct.
After purchase I was then informed delivery would take an extra day. My mistake for not checking delivery date first. 

In addition I was disappointed to hear that had I purchased online any ""rental discounts"" would not be able to be redeemed. This is strange and confusing as I see this a simple process to setup.

It looks like the company have processes that are not customer centric. Especially strange as we live in a world of customer centric retail, which leads to loyalty.

I got the lens and am happy with the product. Indeed I am also happy with, in-person, customer service. However in the future I will consider purchasing through another retailer, if urgency is key.

Canon Pixma 10S,"Ordered a Canon Pixma 10S from WEX at the Photography Show, NEC, Birmingham, induced by double cash back offer, half price ink if bought at same time and free packet of photo paper. Staff were friendly and helpful and the printer arrived on date given. 
However to get the half price inks I wanted I would have to wait for 3 weeks for both the printer and the ink or I could drop the ink order and have the printer in 2 days. I compromised and took the ink available from stock at the show (half of what I had intended to buy).
The printer arrived but no free paper. Phoned up - staff were courteous and paper arrived next day - A4 sample of 9 PermaJet photo papers.
WEX photographic didn't tell me I had to fill in a special double cash back form from Canon so I filled in the standard. Fortunately Canon picked up on this and later directed me to the correct form.
All sorted. 
In retrospect I regret I had not ordered from PermaJet at the show as intended, they had given the same delivery date, a free packet of 25 A3 PermaJet photo papers and an emailed link to the correct double cash back form.

On Friday lunchtime I got a message to say it had been sent to the courier. Saturday came and no lens. I checked the Royal Mail delivery tracker and it was showing nothing.

I dont know if the issue is Wex or Royal Mail but either way Wex choose Royal Mail so the quality of their service reflects on Wex. When I rang the customer service rep just said ""oh, yes, it'll be delivered on Monday now-I'll refund your Saturday postage"". No sorry? No £5 off for messing you about?

To be fair I've shopped with Wex for years and they're usually top notch so I'm putting this down to an anomaly.

At 5pm I was stood right by my local nearest, still open, post office, but no I had to battle through the rush hour traffic, virtually straight past a second post office to get to a third post office, not the one I had nominated and not the one nearest my home. 25 minutes later I got to said post office just in time to collect my parcel, and product is great.

I've asked for the X-T2 back as there are better offers about.

Not full of factory-fresh promise,"I hadn't purchased from Wex photo/video for a while, and decided, due to age and degradation, to replace my old NEC Multisync 20"" monitor with a new 24""NEC P242W 24"" model, and ordered one online for next day delivery.
I can't fault the expedience of the service, as my new monitor arrived the following day in a very large box - a box within a box with good bubble wrap defences - and I carefully cut the seals to the outer box to reveal the monitor box within.
Upon opening this non-sealed container - the two top opening tabs were not taped down in any way - I lifted the monitor carefully out onto my desk, removed the bag covering it and began to inspect the screen, and immediately discovered marks of some kind on it in a couple of places.
I most certainly wasn't going to attempt to remove them or touch the surface in any way, and promptly re-packaged the monitor for a return to Wex.
I telephoned the returns department and was very pleased to have a sympathetic and polite response to my request for an RMA, and duly returned the screen by the Wex courier as instructed.
It was a huge disappointment to have to do this, as the screen should have arrived in pristine condition - costing £599 you wouldn't expect anything less. 
As there were no other machines in stock for a swap-over I had to request a full refund, and decided to source an alternative elsewhere.
I have now received a very nice BenQ 24"" monitor to take it's place, and this arrived fully factory sealed with no blemishes whatsoever- just as it should.
Perhaps this NEC may have been a rogue monitor, escaping the manufacturer's quality control, but the lack of any box sealing troubled me a little, and I will be hesitant in ordering anything in the future without reassurance that it is a fully sealed factory fresh unit, and definitely unopened.
Rather a negative shopping event in some ways, but at least my return was handled very politely for a full refund.
Unfortunately I cannot give more than an average score on this purchase experience.",,2018-12-21T17:29:53Z,3,Pete Ware,"Gillingham, GB",4

Disappointed,"I have generally found Wex Photo Video and it's earlier incarnations to be competent and fair where new equipment is concerned. Budget constraints have meant that of late I have purchased a number of used items. Generally I have been well satisfied, but unfortunately, with Wex I have been less so. I have been sold two lenses with unacceptable defects. A camera body that I have recently purchased as 'opened box' and 'showing signs of testing' looked more used/damaged (cosmetically) than this description would justify, although it was indeed very new and functional. Wex have never refused to accept defective items back, but it is disappointing to have to do so. Ultimately Wex rely on the honesty of those part exchanging equipment, but I feel that a degree more keen observation and testing may be in order.",,2018-12-03T17:04:06Z,3,John Reader,,21

Beware Offers,"Bought a Manfrotto tripod from the Commercial Road store because the saleperson pointed out that the head (an essential but separate item) was on free-offer from Manfrotto. Salesperson told me the head would arrive from Manfrotto ""in a few days"". Wouldn't have purchased otherwise. Reality: Manfrotto T&Cs (not evident until after tripod purchase, trip home and an on-line claim next day) say up to 60days. Wex HQ washed hands but happy to take the money. Sharp practice! Unusable tripod for up to 60 days. Thanks Wex.",,2018-11-19T09:58:33Z,3,Steve,,2
WEX and returns,"I am unhappy about the way WEX drive a coach and horses through the wording of the Consumer Rights Act when a product is defective by trying to force the customer to wait perhaps indefinitely for a manufacture to carry out a repair, and insisting on a credit note rather than a refund if there are then issues with a repair or replacement.
Because of this I will not buy from WEX again once my current credit note is used.

I used part of the previous credit to buy a Benro G2 head.
This head can ""sort of"" can do the job advertised.

The head plate supplied has too small a raised rubber footprint to hold a larger DSLR camera with 24-70 zoom lens, weight 5 pounds, for more than a few minutes without ""twist"", even with the lock screw tightened with the provided Allen key.
The head is advertised as being able to support 36 pounds in weight!

Tightening the plate with the Allen key on the latest Benro plates causes paint to come off the underside of the plate. 
Just setting up the head once means it is unlikely to remain in pristine new condition.

The Benro plate I bought in July and August remain in good condition after 4 months of normal use.

The G2 head paint (as distinct from the plate paint) comes off far quicker than on the B1 Benro head I bought in July.

The blue collar surrounding the tension adjuster is secured by ""light strength glue"" - and just falls off!
Fortunately in my case at home rather than in the middle of a field.

If the collar is not in place the tension setting tends to change when adjusting the head angle, yet there seems no satisfactory way to permanently fit the collar in place.

Although the G2 can do its intended function some of the time, overall I rate it as 2 star.

After the hassle of returning a previous Benro tripod, agreed after more than 2 weeks by Benro as faulty, I see no point in going through similar hassle a second time.

On the one hand I can sympathise with WEX if Benro products cannot adequately do what they are advertised to do, if Benro has significantly reduce the quality of the paint finish over a 4 month period and if parts now just fall off in normal use.

On the other hand the relevant legislation implies this should be a problem for WEX and not the customer.

***

For the reply from WEX below, to which I cannot find any any to reply, WEX have made a bad situation worse.

When I returned the second defective Benro Tripod within days of receiving it despite my asking for a refund I was told I could not have a refund - and that I had to accept a credit.

WEX seem to ignore that I have used part of the credit to buy a Benro G2 head - which is also defective!

The locking knob collar falls off in normal use, being held in place by low strength glue instead of a more secure thread.

Naturally I have photos which WEX can view - once they grasp that the current issue is a defective G2 head, not the earlier defective tripods.

A ""repair"" or replacement seems pointless as any replacement is likely to have the same design defect.

With 6 Benro QR plates that are not interchangeable with most other brands I am left between a rock and a hard place.

Soldier on with a defective design product unsuitable for normal use - or throw away £140 in QR plates?",,2018-11-16T09:15:52Z,3,Leonard Shepherd,,9
Poor Customer service,"Bought used Vixia Camera to save cost  
1. suddenly they refuse me VAT on that purchase without warning. Iam a business, I need a VAT receipt. They told me they use VAT account margining on used goods. Fair enough.. but I need VAT to reduce item item cost. I request to opt out as I am legally entitled to do so (no loss to them for opting out of their margin VAT accounting on used items), they refused. This means £ 141 item now really like buying a new  to £ 170 item ie its just £ 10 less than brand New. Item RETURNED!

Furthermore, the item I received didn't work. They had failed to check the battery was completely inoperable. Waste of my time and energy, that they failed to spot this in an already  returned item?  I expected better from WEX.

A Little Disappointed,"I ordered a lens and a filter. The order was taken by a very helpful man who informed me that they would come separately. The lens would be with me on the Saturday the following day as I paid extra postage. I tracked my order and right up to 3 pm it was showing as out for delivery then I checked it again and it showed as being sent back to the depot. I rang Wex and spoke to a man who apologised and said he would refund the postage and assured me he would call Parcel Force on Monday to arrange a new delivery as the depot was closed at that time on a Saturday. He assured me he would then call to update me.  I managed to speak to Parcel Force myself on Saturday after speaking to Wex and they said it would be out for delivery on Monday.   My parcel was delivered on Monday and the delivery man said the driver on Saturday had been taken ill. Whilst I understand that Wex have no control over the delivery service the two things I am slightly miffed about is I was told that Parcel Force couldn't be contacted pm on Saturday and the fact that even though promised to call Monday there wasn't a call which isn't very good customer service. Having said all this I have always given 5 stars and think Wex offer a great service but please, if you say you are going to call then follow up on that call, it will make all the difference when someone has been disappointed by not getting their delivery.",,2018-06-28T20:42:07Z,3,Jean,,29

Unable to find out firmware version of used camera before buying,"Before buying a used camera, I wanted to know whether its firmware had been updated and, if not, which firmware version was installed. I was told that firmware was often updated on used cameras when they were prepared for sale but it was not possible to ask anyone in the warehouse to check this on the particular camera that I wanted to buy. I took the risk that I'd have to update it myself (not keen: unreliable broadband) and all turned out well -- the camera arrived with the latest version, which is required for the proper operation of a lens I intend to use. But it made me think twice about placing my order. I think firmware information for used stock should really be added to the condition details on the website at the time of preparation, if it's not going to be possible to enquire about it later.

Part-Exchange experience,"First of all, I would like to emphasise that this is a review of the part-exchange department and not a review of the sales department of Wex who I have always found to be prompt and helpful. 

I have previously part-exchanged with Wex on a number of occasions and in the past it has always been a prompt and efficient process. On this occasion, I was moving from Sony A mount to E mount and had 4 lenses, a battery grip and a DSLR to part-exchange. The first problem arose when the courier arrived to collect only expecting one parcel with only one packing label for three boxes. I had previously told Wex there would be at least two boxes and was informed that this wouldn't cause a problem. This meant that my camera gear had to stay in my workplace overnight for collection the following day.

Once Wex had received the goods on 8 February, this was confirmed and they phoned a couple of days later. 3 of the items - 2 lenses and the grip - were accepted. I was informed that the camera needed a sensor clean - which I accepted but was a bit surprised - and that one lens (a 70-200) had some moisture present - ""just want to get it checked to see if it's in tolerance/anything to worry about"" and that the other one (a 70-300) had a ""squeak in focus movement"". I pointed out that I had purchased the 70-300 only 6 months ago from Wex (used with 12 months warranty) I had only used it once for a specific shoot and had noticed that the focusing was a bit stiff then but just put it down to a characteristic of the lens.. I then had a long email communication with various staff members during which they repeatedly referred to other lens I had purchased and seemed unable to tie up the lens to the original purchase. Fortunately, I had the original purchase invoice and sent it to them and they were finally able to recognise the lens. 

I chased up progress and eventually on the 23 was advised of a repair cost of £66 for the camera which I accepted and was also told that my lens had been sent to Fixation (part of Wex) in error rather than Sony and that it would be sent to Sony as quickly as possible for assessment. 

Today, after a lot more chasing, (including a phone call where I was told I had been paid in full and no items were outstanding)  I have been emailed to say that the repairs are unecomonical - £900 for the 70-200 and £300 for the 70-300 and that my lenses will be returned. I have replied to Wex to ask about the warranty on the 70-300 but have had no reply. I have also asked to see the report from Sony because I am curious how just checking to see if in tolerance limit can progress to what is effectively a write-off. I have had no reply to this either. 
 
So, it has currently taken over a month for Wex to evaluate the lenses and decide that they do not want to proceed. They have ignored or brushed aside any mention of the warranty on the 70-300. I have frequently had to email several times to get a response and quite often have replied to an email within minutes only to not hear back until the following day or later. While I appreciate that they have no obligation to purchase the lenses, this process has taken much longer that it should have done and the general communication is severely lacking. Please note that this review would have still been the same if they had purchased the lenses.

(I have now heard from Wex to say they will look into either repairing or refunding the 70-300 lens so have amended rating to three stars - but am still unhappy about the timescale and communication)

As a final follow up to this, I subsequently part-exchanged the 70-200 lens with another camera supplier who confirmed that there were no issues with it.",,2018-03-13T17:36:59Z,3,Steve Evans,,17

Never the less I waited for a parcel that didn’t arrive on the first notification which obviously was the mainland system and assume they send notifications when they leave there depot which cost me a waisted day it did arrive 2 days later when the tracking had caught up",,2018-02-03T20:19:43Z,3,Mr. Craig Hepburn,,15

And of the item  condition delivered have no  quibble it was virtually perfect  and working,  save the carrying strap  which was a part of the original  product was not included. I have no great issue with this save  it is an aspect that I should have been mad aware of.  It not being there was a little disappointing.
The service otherwise is quick easy to use and efficient.  I have used Wex  before and will use them again.",,2018-02-01T19:50:49Z,3,Foxwood,,26
Took over a month and a lot of calls but got there in the end,"I made an order with Wex over a month ago. Since then I have been chasing after parts of my order every week. Each time I call I am told something has arrived in stock and that it will arrive in a week but over a month later and after spending over a thousand pounds on a business order, I'm tired of chasing my order down. I've never had chase an order so much. I now need to go on a shoot without the equipment I'm still waiting for (which I have explained to them several times). If you are trying to run a business, ordering from Wex has shown to be a liability.
The staff are polite and well mannered and the prices are reasonable. If you don't mind not knowing when you'll get your order then you'll be fine.

EDIT: Following this review (and the polite response below) Wex have canceled my outstanding items with no other communication. I never asked to cancel my order, ideally I'd like the order fulfilled! I imagine my experience is a non-typical one and it's a shame that in the month of communication this is the first indication that Wex have indicated that they cannot provide the item/s following a public expression. Lastly just to be clear, the staff are always pleasant, it's just been a long struggle to ultimately not get everything I ordered.

EDIT 2: I'm writing this after the above and I've added a star to my review. I for a call from the assistant corporate manager who was very helpful and eager to resolve my order. She arranged for my product to be sent out to arrive this morning and now I'm am able to get to my shoot with the items I was missing.
I did order these items over a month ago and it's evident that speaking on here is what moved things along in the end which is a shame, and although I don't really see it as acceptable service, they made the effort in the end so I've improved the rating. As I said before, I'm sure this is not a typical case.",,2018-01-24T10:13:57Z,3,James Cardus,,1

A bit more hassle than is usual for Wex,"I've been using Wex for all my photo purchases for years. Always a faultless and issue free experience, until this last order. I can understand the wrong product being sent instead of what I ordered once, but when its replacement turned up the following day, and was the same wrong item as had been dispatched previously, I was a little disappointed. I'd had a conversation with the customer service team as soon as I opened my parcel to find the wrong item, so thought they would look into why I had been sent a more expensive, but 'wrong' item. The second call to customer services was a little different. The advisor seemed as upset as I was that my experience was less than I was used to and said he would get to the bottom of the problem. This he did and called me back to tell me the outcome. Thankfully the correct item arrived the following day. 
I'd still not hesitate to use Wex, but my expectation levels are now a nudge lower than they were.",,2017-11-01T09:24:08Z,3,Richard Crompton,,18
Postal problems,"I have ordered from wex on many occasions without an issue or problem, however this time, there was problems with the postage (not the product), when paid for a next day delivery it does not arrive.

Parcelforce almost always seem to mess up my deliveries and what's more, they don't seem to care. I have used many others like Hermes, UKMail, UPS, Royal Mail, and DPD and so far without any problems. Parcelforce have delivered ""before 10.30"" deliveries 24 hours late on two occasions as well as just later the same day on numerous occasions.

Nikon D800E Dusty Sensor and Mirror,"I bought a used Nikon D800E through Wex and was very pleased with the speedy dispatch and delivery. Literally, the only complaint I have is that the listing described the item sensor as being dust free, which it absolutely was not. In fact it was very dusty. I'm not saying this is a huge deal as I can just pay to have it cleaned, but ultimately when you're spending over £1000, you expect product descriptions to be accurate. An accurate description is everything when you're buying second hand.

Other than that, the experience was overwhelmingly positive.",,2017-10-21T10:21:11Z,3,Jamie Chorley,,9
Item arrived on time which was great,"Item arrived on time which was great, the item had a brief test on arrival (not in depth as its a Sachtler tripod at the end of the day) however on the first shoot one leg didn't lock after being extended fully for the first time. A minor repair job was done with the screw and we got it working, although don't really expect to have to do that to a £500 tripod, after the shoot and during re-packing I noticed the QC Sachtler label had not been signed, although date and packing had.

Ok but room for improvement,"I ordered a Sigma 20mm F1.4 for my Canon as i wanted some wide angle shots for product photography. I ordered it on Thursday for Friday delivery as i wanted to use it for the weekend. I was very surprised to have to pay for next day delivery (£4.99) at the price point of the lens.

Sadly the arrived faulty and would only focus about 1 in 10 times so i immediately phoned for a return/replacement. I asked about getting a swop by the courier but was told this wasn't possible unless i purchased a second lens and would then get a refund for the faulty one once it had been tested. The return process was straightforward (i was emailed some pre-paid return labels) all i had to do was box it up and drop it at the post office. By this time though it was passed last collection so i dropped it off Saturday morning meaning it wasnt collected from the post office until monday morning by Parcelforce. I emailed Wex separately about having to pay for next day delivery for the faulty lens hoping for this to be refunded given the circumstances but that part of my question was ignored.

The replacement lens arrived the following Wednesday and works fine. The lens itself is very good and produces a significantly sharper image than my Canon 24-105F4L lens which lives on my camera most of the time. Im very impressed with the lens itself so far and am looking for new opportunities to use it.",,2017-07-24T07:56:09Z,3,Leigh,,24
Purchased a Used Nikon Lens & Filter,"Purchased a used Nikon 14-24mm f4 lens that appears in very good condition & as described.  I am very pleased with this.
Also purchased a used Hoya 77mm Pro1 Digital UV Filter.  This was advertised as in condition 9 with very minimal scratches.  On inspection during a period of bright sunlight, I found numerous circumferential scratches on the glass around the edge of the filter.

Online ordering perfect. Personal contact ignored,"I ordered  Lee Filters Hood online without problems. Personal contact to obtain a discount arranged by Lee Filters was ignored. Had I been able to order the item elsewhere I would have done.

I debated a two star..............,"I debated a two star, but most of the problem rests with 'Fujifilm' I had a bad experience from ordering the X-T20 on10th Feb to receiving it 8th April. Virtually two months. I made my purchase by part exchanging my X-T10. Being without my 'small' camera for 8 weeks was unexpected. I really think that better information from Fujifilm to Wex then onto the customer could be greatly improved. After the 1st month went by, and I realised that I was not part of the 1st wave of camera's to Wex, I started to ring Wex quite often to try to get a date for a delivery. I had mixed messages from the excellent customer service staff; it was obvious they had no idea. I had a holiday planned and really wanted my small camera back. I rang Fuji 3 times, twice they promised to return my call with info, they didn't until two days prior to delivery. Surely a better more informative chain of info could be available, production numbers must be known and therefore distribution info available. If I had known it would be 8 weeks, I could have planned accordingly. Nevertheless, Wex does a good job, Fuji take note.",,2017-04-13T20:18:42Z,3,Barry Bullough,,6
Generally pleased with purchase,"Overall I am happy with my recent purchase. 

One thing of note however. The item was advertised as 9+ in used section but I did find a fault that should have been picked up by Wex. A battery has clearly leaked in the remote and as such the terminals were dirty. The remote did not work until I cleaned the terminals to remove the greenish oxidised residue. 

May seem a small thing but it's not 'almost like new'.",,2017-03-22T11:51:53Z,3,Scott Hamilton,,7
Efficient delivery and advice BUT...,"Ordered a range of items, and advice over the phone was helpful when needed. Most items were delivered promptly, but two were not. In fact, updates stopped coming, and several weeks later I had to enquire as to what had happened: one of the items was in stock but being held pending arrival of the final item, without consulting me as to my need for it. I duly asked for the available item to be sent forthwith, now finally received. However, it's been two months & the final item has still not arrived - blame was laid with the supplier, but the question arises as to why an item is advertised that cannot be supplied. Responsibility for that is with WEX! A compromised customer experience!",,2017-03-21T23:17:34Z,3,Martin,,15
Pleasant even if not a perfect service,"Ordered and paid for an item said to be in stock only to receive an email later the same day to say it was not actually in stock. Gave me the option of cancelling the order altogether or taking delivery of the one item they had and waiting for the other to come into stock. Still waiting to hear when the out of stock item will come into stock from their supplier. Suggests stock taking is a bit awry.  Otherwise nice company to deal with and would have had 5 * based on this and previous experiences.

Update. Out of stock item now supplied well within the target date.   Thank you Wex. Despite this unfortunate situation, we all make mistakes, it is what we do to rectify these errors that matters. I would be happy to recommend this  company.",,2017-03-14T21:17:30Z,3,Jaay Tee,,15
Let down by delivery,"Should be five stars.  Knowledgeable, friendly people.  Competitive prices.  But use Parcel Force who can only give delivery day, not time, not even morning or afternoon.  So had to hang about for most of the day waiting for delivery.  Other couriers are much more helpful.

Usual friendly service but sent wrong product initially,"Generally, Wex is superb – not always the cheapest but friendly, honest and reliable with great customer service. What's great is that you can always speak to a real person and obtain useful advice or correct things when they go wrong. On this occasion, one element of my order was wrong; the wrong product was included. Speaking to customer service got a replacement sent out the next day, no questions asked, which duly arrived on time (important because we were travelling the following day). The return was requested (at my convenience) and was easy with pre-paid label and the original packaging. Overall, it was a brief disappointment that the warehouse initially picked and despatched the wrong product but Wex were very quick to put it right. I will continue to use Wex as they are friendly and easy to deal with, and they have a great range of stock.",,2017-01-14T10:29:50Z,3,Nick de Cent,,9
"WEX does everything well, with the exception of making me feel they doing all they can for me.","Great web site giving all the information you could ever need. Stock position always seems accurate and goods are delivered as promised and packed well. So thats the post and pre-sales sorted.
As for the sales effort.... poor, poor, poor.
I tried hard to lower the price of the D500 i recently purchased, with out success, and without interest from WEX. Faced with a take it or leave it attitude i had to remind them that they were running a money off offer on orders over a certain amount. 
They express no interest or surprise when i highlighted a better offer from a well know competitor.
I only purchased the D500 from WEX as i had a credit on my account.

Come on WEX, your a great company but your Sales approach is that of a box shifter, left me feeling as if i was buying a grey import.

"Ordering ok, untrustworthy delivery","Wex online ordering is straight forward and easy, as you'd expect but had a total nightmare with the delivery from Parcelforce. 
I paid for next day shipping as I was going on a long holiday at the end of that week. I then spent the entire week chasing down the parcel that Parcelforce had registered as having been delivered and signed for. It was all complete lies - the driver had manually registered it into the system himself using my colleague's name (no signature, mind you) and never delivered it.  
I was quite disappointed with Wex customer service as they really didn't bother to do much. They said they would arrange for a driver interview but I didn't hear back from Wex again. I called 3, maybe 4 times to follow up but didn't really get much joy. I felt it was all a bit of a weak effort on their part.
There's waay too much reliance on the Parcelforce tracking system saying that the parcel was delivered. 

I had to completely rebuy the items I wanted (at full price but free express shipping this time) and left to chase down Parcelforce myself.  
To cut a long story short - after many calls and stomping of feet, the parcel was still at the depot and I picked it up, literally, as I was on the way to the airport.
Now I have 2 sets of Lee filters (I hate to think of the stress levels if I had been buying a camera or lens!!) and will see how much 'fun' the returns system is going to be when I'm back .....",,2016-12-10T19:00:03Z,3,A.M.Y,,1
"Good service from Wex, very poor attitude shown by delivery driver.","I was on my drive talking to a friend when the truck arrived . The driver's handling of the packages left a great deal to be desired and when I realised that the large box he almost dropped as it left the truck was mine I was a bit apprehensive, He did not seem overly concerned at my apprehension, nor did he treat the packages under which mine was lying with much care. Sure enough the box that mine came in was torn with air bags stuffing coming out and one corner was obviously the worse for poor handling prior to delivery. I photograped the box once unloaded but the driver wasn't the slightest bothered and when I was hesitant about signing he said I could write in that the package was damaged, which I did. I accepted the printer and once the printer box was out of the exterior box the corner was quite bent but inside there were Canon tubes and very well thought out packaging. Well done Canon. Next time I'll drive up to PCWorld or somewhere because even though the printer is working I'll never know if its' rough handling has any detrimental effects on it's longevity, will I? In the end no matter how good it is I'll always wonder if it's suddenly going to stop working because it was handled badly when delivered. Not good.",,2016-12-06T21:40:38Z,3,DP,,1
The item I was sent had been opened before.,"I bought this as a gift but the packaging was dirty and torn, the seal had been broken and the box bulged a little as though the contents had been removed and then replaced less precisely than it was in the factory.

Because it was a gift, I had to return it. Whilst that cost me no money, I had to re-pack it, go to the Post Office with it, queue for 15 minutes and then wait another 5 minutes for the clerk to check it in. Bang goes one lunch break. Now, when I get the replacement, instead of handing it to the recipient I have to post it, which *will* cost me money - and even more time.

Wex have always been very good in the past and their customer service has responded properly in this case. I will use them again but I am still left with a bad feeling. The dispatcher should have seen the item was faulty but sent it anyway with the result that I have ended up being inconvenienced.",,2016-12-05T12:03:18Z,3,Peter Z,,8

Again I've ordered items purporting to be in stock and not until the order has actually been placed have I found out via email that they are actually out of stock and I'm on a waiting list.  Why can't I be advised before I hit the 'place order' button that it's not actually in stock, giving me the option of shopping elsewhere for an urgent item?",,2016-12-03T21:10:15Z,3,Andrew Bracken,,40
Almost trouble free,"This is my first ever major camera. I didn't really know what I was looking for but I settled for this. I ordered a used one as the new ones were out of stock. I did get a number of varying dates with every phone call from different sales people which was very off putting. I'd spoke to Panasonic myself and they had given me dates which wasn't difficult to find out, but wex said they didn't know. 

The camera came through okay but it's quite dusty which I had to give it a clean before use. The battery doesn't seem to be holding its charge well, after 11 minutes of use its flashing at me from full.",,2016-11-20T19:32:48Z,3,Craig Heywood,,8
Screen clean,"Ordered a Focusing screen for a Nikon F6 film camera. The screen was supposed to be NEW. When it arrived I was anxious to get it into my camera. However on inspection of the screen prior to fitting I noticed that there was a scuff mark on it.
My assumption is that it is either a second hand screen or Nikon's inspection process is not very good.
Wex immediately sent me a return form and free postage agreeing to refund the cost of the screen.
The refund took several days but there was no argument or fuss so I am very happy with the service provided and will continue to purchase from Wex in the future.
They are always courteous and very willing to help whatever the problem.",,2016-11-18T14:06:29Z,3,Brian,,19

Initially the experience was awful - my call to the help-desk almost made me feel it was my fault - not very happy!  However, once I got to a manager a few days later all was resolved and the camera was dispatched in record time.

Patience Wearing Thin,"I used to sing the praises of Wex particularly when I first started to use them. However, I have had to send another item back because it wasn't satisfactory. I don't really buy that much from them but, this is the second item so soon this year, that has fell short of acceptable. The last item I didn't bother sending back (slight damage to an aluminium case) because of the bulk. But more in truth, it was of poor quality and not worth the hassle - money down the drain. 

Last year I had to send a bag back because the handle was missing. In all three cases the items looked like returns - certainly the last item sent back; the backing card had been creased in half! This, 30 days returns policy, is of no benefit to me. I investigate, I choose, I buy, I keep - this is how it should be. 

In Wex's favour, customer service is excelllent and delivery prompt. But they are expensive for the run-of-the-mill stuff - I certainly wouldn't buy a camera from them. Price matching for me is not an option - why would I need to do this when I can just buy from the cheaper shop? And in this instance my local photo dealer seems to be the way to go (surprisingly).

This leads me to their part exchange deals which I had entertained of doing with them not so long ago. All I can say is, you won't get very much. My local photo dealer in my home city, gave me over twice (x2) the amount that Wex offered! No-brainer!

Finally; I only use Wex now for items that I can't source locally. To their credit this is quite comprehensive but, I will only use them if I have to. This will save me, grief, aggravation, and not feeling of being cajoled into filling these Trustpilot reviews!",,2016-07-13T19:05:26Z,3,Simon,,22

"Great Company to deal with, pity about the delivery","I have bought a few items off Wex Photographic and the buying process has always been seamless. However, the last twice I've bought off you the items have not arrived on time. I always pay for next day delivery (before 12:30 if possible) and have had to spend hours on the phone to Parcelforce to find out why my parcel has not arrived!!! The last item arrived two days late. Whilst I appreciate that it is the delivery company at fault, it gives me great concern when I order from you that my item will arrive certainly on time. Because of this I have reluctantly reverted to buy from Amazon (I've just purchased a 50mm 1.8 lens) to go with the Sony A6300 bought off you, and it arrive as promised the next day.

Let me finish by saying your customer service is first class, but until you change your carrier I'll be reluctant to purchase from you. I will be in the market to buy the Sony G Master 24-70 and 70-200 in the near future certainly before the winter. Sorry for the criticism, but parcelforce stinks.",,2016-06-30T18:13:48Z,3,Roger Daniel,,5

Rating of lens quality to the quality of the lens,"After buying a second hand lens from wex in the past I had no hesitation in spending £1150 on another on. I found their ratings to be spot on and as described, however my latest purchase which was rated the same as my last lens was in far worse condition. The lens mechanically no doubt meets the rating and performs well however the cosmetic side of the lens had way more paint missing / scratches (some as advertised was an understatement) and this was after I even verified this with the sales guy who confirmed it was light markings.

I will definitely think twice now before I trust the ratings of a used lens",,2016-05-27T17:58:53Z,3,One happy customer,,6

Recent 10% offer on Canon lenses,"I recently took advantage of 10% off a Canon 70-200mm lens offer. Wex are usually excellent and provide a pretty good service. However, on this occasion having placed my order AND double-checked the item was in stock (via the email link on my Mac), when the order was confirmed I received a message saying the lens was NOT in stock. Very inconvenient especially as I had negotiated a deal with my local supplier (albeit at a worse price). The lens arrived after a delay of about 5 days (and is excellent!). A couple of emails went unanswered particularly when I asked if there was any financial recompense. Another email re a potential discount on a Canon 2x extender also went unanswered. To be positive, I received a ""sincere apology"" but no offer of any other ""compensation."" A discount/voucher on my next order would have been a help. I will PROBABLY use Wex again (I have spent several thousand pounds over the last 3y) but will shop around and if the price is the same elsewhere will consider using an alternative supplier.

Great Item-packing materials very poor,"Item in stock and good price.
However I was told on the phone that the item would be packed in a box to protect it, When it arrived it was in a padded bag that had split in transit and was resealed by the courier.

Item does appear to work correctly so no issues there but it could easily have been destroyed or lost completely during transit. 

Unfortunately Wex have packed things like this in the past (last time it was a lens) and I specifically checked this time when making a telephone order and was assured it would be packaged safely. 

Personally I will not be buying from them in the future as I cannot be sure that they will pack properly to protect items in the postal service.",,2016-04-29T12:27:04Z,3,Simon Platt,,13
Curates egg,"Hope my love affair with Wex isn't over. 

Have been a very happy customer of their's over the years. All of the orders I've placed were with a 24 hour delivery. My last order was set up on a 3-4 day delivery as I knew I wouldn't be at home for a couple of days. Blow me it arrived the next day, or rather a card saying it had been taken to a local Post Office as there was no answer. I went to the Post Office and it wasn't with them. Parcel Force said it was and had been signed for by someone at the PO at 10:03 (4 hours before I called.) I went back the next day to the Post Office and they said it had been dropped in late afternoon yesterday.

I informed Wex about this and other than the standard acknowledgement have heard nothing further. Quite a surprise.",,2016-04-29T12:00:47Z,3,Michael Ward,,5
"Fair enough, but delivery service needs to improve","I have been a customer of WEX for several years and bought many thousands of pounds worth of equipment from them over that time.
There has never been any problem with any of the items I have bought from them, and if ever I have phoned, they have always been pleasant, polite and helpful. The Part Exchange service offers very reasonable prices for used equipment.
There seems to be almost no competition on prices between WEX and the various other internet retailers, nor some high street stores now - all offer more or less identical prices on major equipment items, at least for Canon and Fuji products.
My only real gripe with WEX is with the courier they use - having paid extra for Saturday delivery, I waited in all day but the delivery didn't come. Not really WEX's fault directly, but there have been issues more than once and they should offer more options than just Parcelforce even if it means the customer paying a bit more.
The WEX web storefront is very nice and reasonably easy to search for what you want. So, overall, you get what you pay for, but there are no benefits to being a regular or loyal customer; prices are pretty much on a par with several others and delivery service can be a bit flaky - hence 3 stars. Not bad, but scope for being much better.",,2016-04-07T18:21:50Z,3,Roland Bogush,,2
Problems with delivery,I was telephoned by Wex on 24th March to ensure I would be available for delivery on the 29th March.  The goods were being delivered by Parcel Force and the tracking information was hopeless with no time frame for delivery.  Despite waiting in all day the item was not delivered.  The tracking info said a delivery had been attempted and a card had been left neither of which was true.  I phoned Wex the following day who initially said that it would be delivered that day but later admitted that Parcel Force had no idea where the item was.  The promised return call from Wex to update me never happened and the item was not delivered until the 31st.  I wasted 2 days waiting for it and had to make 3 calls to Wex to chase it up. I was disappointed that Wex did not  apologise.,,2016-04-04T16:34:18Z,3,HL,,32
Good - but with sour taste left.,"I ordered £1,600 worth of equipment from Wex on Monday evening and paid for next-day delivery (Wednesday.) I decided to use their financing system, offered by Barclays which all went smoothly and within minutes I had received full acceptance, confirmation and was finished.

On Tuesday I noticed that the order wasn't moving so called Wex to check. They said Barclays hadn't yet released the funds and advised me to call them. I duly did so, and Barclays assured me they'd prioritise things and get the funds moving within the hour.

I then called Wex back to ensure they would pick things up straight away once funds were released. This is where things go awry. I spoke with quite a patronising agent who seemed determined to talk over me. He said things like, ""I don't know who you spoke to at Barclays or the nature of the conversation."" He seemed determined to shirk any responsibility or assist in any way. All I was asking for was for reassurance that, as it was 2pm, there was still adequate time to dispatch if funds were realised immediately, as Barclays had said their would be.

When I'd spoken to Barclays (who were extremely polite and helpful) I'd been transferred through to the payouts team. While on the phone an agent had gone through my account and done the necessary to release the funds. It's a 95% automatic process, with a final sanity-check by a human-being. I mentioned this to the agent at Wex, who said (I'm paraphrasing) ""I doubt you spoke to anyone who actually makes the decisions.""

I went on to explain I'd paid extra for next-day delivery not realising there might be a delay in processing the funds. He said, ""If you read your paperwork it clearly states it can take up to a couple of days."" Well, now I'm annoyed... first at the implication that I didn't read the paperwork (I read it thoroughly) and secondly, if it was mentioned anywhere, it was far from ""clear."" At the point I outright called him defensive and said ""Look. If you receive the funds this afternoon, will you be dispatching this or not?"" I finally got the straightforward answer I wanted - ""Yes, the process is automatic."" I wasn't being a difficult customer - I just wanted some quiet reassurance. All he had to say was ""Hi sir, no problems here. If Barclays have told you they're releasing the funds now, we'll receive them straight away and get this out to you for tomorrow"" but Mr. High-and-mighty decided to take a more defensive passive-aggressive stance for absolutely no reason whatsoever!

Wex have a reputation for good customer service, and I actually placed my order with them on that basis. I'm a first time customer with a relatively big order and my experience has been soured by one patronising - no, rude - customer service rep who really should be taken back in for some training.

The order was picked an hour later and is currently out for delivery with Parcel Force.",,2016-03-16T01:44:41Z,3,Gary W,,4
gift vouchers,"Ordered on monday morning, also checked on phone they would be sent that day, as I need them by wednesday. i didn't get the order tuesday so phoned and was told they wasn't sent and will be sent that day. vouchers didn't arrive till thursday. i was emailed a pdf of the vouchers to give on wednesday but thats not the same.",,2016-03-06T10:36:52Z,3,Kim Smith,"Woodham Ferrers, GB",12
DELAYED POSTAGE,HAVING USED WEX FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HAVING NOTHING BUT 5 STAR SERVICE I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT DESPITE ORDERING ON FRIDAY MORNING WITH 24HR DELIVERY THE PRODUCT ARRIVED AFTER 2PM ON MONDAY - UNFORTUNATELY AFTER I HAD SET OFF FOR MY PHOTOGRAPHIC HOLIDAY TO ICELAND,,2016-02-15T16:59:13Z,3,JEFF MOORE,,1
Support never got back to me.,"Ordered on Friday 30th and paid for a Saturday 7th delivery, got the delivery 1 week early when I wasn't home.
Customer service said they would help but never got back to me.
Had to go collect the package on a weekday.
So I basically paid for a Saturday delivery for no reason.",,2015-11-07T14:57:55Z,3,Matthew Chan,,3
Dissapointment in the Tail,"Buying from Wex is generally a good experience, I've used them a few times now.     However, I was disappointed this time.  I bought a Canon DLSR plus battery grip, and the day it was dispatched a new offer was launched to include a free Tripod.  That offer was available for two days before my camera arrived, I was very inclined to cancel and reorder to get the tripod, but I thought Wex would probably include it anyway do I didn't.   That was my mistake, so I lost out on the Tripod.   I shall go back to my usual supplier after this experience, they would have included the tripod.",,2015-10-31T19:23:17Z,3,S Lloyd,,6
Your delivery company lets you down,"Since Wex has changed from using Royal Mail next day delivery service  to using Parcelforce their service is disapointing. Next day delivery with parcelforce has failed more times than it has succeeded for me , such a shame. This is the only thing that lets wex down. Your prices are great and customer service is good. Please bring back Royal Mail as my postman always got my order to me on the next day.",,2015-10-26T19:11:45Z,3,Louise Howell,,2
A pity the item was faulty,"I ordered a G Tech 1TB backup drive for my iMac after having used an identical 500 Gb G Tech unit for three years. The new item was faulty and was returned using Wex's pre-paid label routine. The outer packaging used by Wex is not re-usable in the manner in which it is wrapped. So despite the Wex contacts being friendly and the refund being swift I did lose a whole afternoon driving to WH Smiths to buy a £6.99 pack of shipping bags, then drive home to pack the item, and then drive to a Post Office to ship the item. So, because the item was faulty, it cost me about £10 and three hours work, ultimately to fail in my quest for the product. This is quite annoying.",,2015-10-26T18:59:21Z,3,Chris Saywood,,43
Disappointed,"I part exchanged a camera to pre-order the new Fuji X70 which came with a free case.
Pete in the Part Ex Department was really helpful. Unfortunately it ended there. The new camera arrived but I had to wait for the case and when it arrived it was brown in colour and as I had bought a black camera I called WEX as their website stated that a black case was available.
I spoke to Katie who was extremely abrupt and rude, and I had to ask to speak to a Manager, and was put through to Lee Flynn.
Although he was reasonably helpful he couldn't be bothered to call me back personally after investigating the problem and got Katie to call me instead. No apology for her rudeness earlier on and still very abrupt.
The result is that I have since bought a Special Edition Fuji X-T1 from a different dealer as I am not comfortable dealing with WEX's Sales Department any longer. A great shame as their Part Exchange staff are superb.",,2015-06-25T13:02:21Z,3,David Cooper,"Barnet, GB",16
"Poor Pre-Sales customer service, promises of call backs never fulfilled.","I wanted to order a camera housing that on the Wex Photographic web site is show as not in stock, (shown as ""5-7 Days""). I fully understand that not every item can be held in stock and was willing to wait a week for it, however since the item was not in stock I called Wex Photographic to confirm that the item was in stock with their supplier to ensure I didn’t face any unexpected longer delays. The call was answered quickly and handled efficiently, the item details and my contact details taken (phone and e-mail) with the promise they would check with the supplier and call me back. Several days passed and I had not heard back so I called again, I explained I was expecting a call back about an item not held in stock and again the item details and my contact details were taken with the promise they would call me back. Here we are a week later and still no call back. If Wex Photographic can’t be bothered with pre-sales questions/issues what hope is there getting anything sorted if there is a problem once they have your money?!

Hi Lee, thanks for looking into this, 1.5 hours from bad review to resolved, just a shame the normal sales channels weren't so efficient. (I've raised my review to 3 stars to reflect the final outcome).

Good price - poor service,"Last Thursday I went online to order a camera from WEX but found that the website wasn’t working properly.  I called customer support who put me on to someone else who took my particulars and said someone would call later in the afternoon.  I went out later in the morning and then had a call back which I missed, called them back and was told again someone would call later.
Later that day I received another call and was told paper work for the 0% finance would be in the post.  It arrived promptly the following morning but with a covering letter stating that the loan for the camera was interest bearing which was completely wrong.  I then had to call WEX again and ask for an email confirming it was 0%.  After another chaser the email finally arrived, allowing me to return the paperwork first class.  This meant that WEX should have received the letter on Saturday or Monday at the latest but I had to again call on Wednesday for an update. The camera finally arrived on Friday morning.
Although the price and terms of the offer were very good, the processing of the sale was just the reverse and I doubt that I would use the company again.",,2013-12-05T21:37:57Z,3,Phil  Alexandrou,,2
"Small items of low cost need a different postage system, it is too expensive","I have ordered two items recently, which were small and of low cost, but WEX do not have a lower, less hassle, system for posting these items.
They are sent, to be signed for, with a minimum cost of £2.99. The item in this order cost £2.99.
This is nonsense and I would not have ordered it from WEX if I could have found the item with another supplier.
I order frequently from ""Premier-Ink"" as they have a reliable, eminently sensible system, for all their stock which costs £1.99 and is sent normal 1st. class Royal Mail and I always receive the items next day.
A cheaper, quicker, simpler system than WEX.",,2013-10-19T12:28:31Z,3,Clive,,8
supplied use as new,"After ordering a fuji x-t1which came used not new returned then was sent a new one, I ordered a Metabone speed booster that came used returned for a new one and was sent back the same one both the return and the so called new one had the same serial number 4897050181478 after a phone call again was told the first one had gone into the bargain basement, I then told him this as the same code on it  and you don't get two with the same number he had a word with the Boss and got a £25 discount less than 10% off a £379 item, I kept it as I had waited in for four days for two items, it looks to me as Wex send out used items as new I am in the retail trade myself and feel this is not !st class service as I have had from them over the past years, will think twice about trading with them again.

Customer service could be better,"I understood the terms and conditions and return policy of the company, however, it would have been nice to have discussed the item, (of which they only had 1).  I was also considering buying a lens filter/protector. Because it was a Saturday, there was no live chat or person answering the telephone when I rang. The store was shown as being open. The telephone switched to answerphone and as prompted I left a message with my contact number for someone to call back. I sincerely thought someone would do that, even if it was by the end of that day. I appreciate store staff could be busy. Sadly, a week later there has not been any contact. I did make the purchase of the lens, but decided to buy a filter from another seller. In short, if you have an answerphone and request details so you can call the customer back, then do it! The item was packaged well and arrived promptly. Customer experience let down by a lack of customer service.",,2013-09-14T13:06:01Z,3,mike,,37
"Great service as usual, but this time something was missing!","I have bought many pieces of my equipment at WEX, always considering it one of the best photographic shops for quality/quantity of products, prices and precision of service/delivery.
However, this time I have been quite disappointed to see that one of the received items was missing of a small (but somehow very useful) part.
I am referring to the Manfrotto Lino Pro VII Messenger Bag, which arrived without the padded ""L-shape"" camera bracket (the red padded sausage that helps to keep camera and lens secured inside the bag).
I have noticed that the package was ripped in one corner, but I think that wasn't enough for someone to take the padding out.
I have reported to Wex customer service, being asked then to return the bag for substitution. I have declined the offer, since I am already using it and it will cause me more annoyance to wait for a complete substitution, while I was hoping for a simpler delivery of the missing part.
Hope this could help for future quality checking.
Kind regards,

Have to pay for two shipment,Order two cameras and are told they are shipped the same day. Do receive both cameras a few days later just to find out the shipping cost have been charged for both cameras. Have been trying to get one of the shipping cost refunded for weeks with out any luck.
