5,Trustpilot,2,"i have been a wex photo video customer for many years now, and i have just purchased a professional camcorder via the wex website. i already had a pretty firm idea of which camera i wanted to get, but the clear and informative product information on the wex website helped inform my decision. the ordering and checkout process was very straightforward, with next day delivery available at no extra charge. the camera arrived on the day and at the time indicated, suitably packaged as expected and with no problems. i have also recently purchased items in store, and i have always found the sales team very knowledgeable and helpful. i can thoroughly recommend wex photo video.",Positive,"{'Delivery', 'Electronics'}","No issues detected; review is positive, specific, and mentions a professional camcorder purchase from Wex Photo Video website."
2,Trustpilot,0,"this review is being submitted as wex regularly invite me to do so, otherwise i would not recant the story behind this purchase. reviews are only of value if there is something which might be learned for the benefit of customers and for the supplier, if the review is objective, balanced, truthful and can be supported by quite reasonable evidence. the purchase of this recent camera was preceded by a trade -in to part fund the purchase of this model when one became available at a future date… which came about soon after. a price  was agreed and dpd collected my equipment on time and the following day i received a message from wex to advise my equipment had been received and would be valued within 2-5 working days. a week went by without further communication from wex so i messaged to enquire of the progress. the response indicated wex had not in fact received my camera but a kettle in its place. no-one had informed me about this and it seems dpd were conducting a search to try to locate the lost package…. poor communication. in the message received, the kettle mentioned had a brand name which minded me of a delivery we had received a few days earlier which, because it was not addressed to me, was assumed to contain items for the greenhouse which were expected that same day. the postal label had the same brand name printed. on opening the package i found some of the items i had forwarded to wex… the camera body, the strap and av leads, which appeared to be undisturbed in the lower chamber of the box. however, the battery, battery charger, manual, assorted point of original sale documents and the covering letter of inventory were all missing… these had been secured in a sealed plastic wallet in the upper chamber. it seems dpd had delivered my equipment to a company in london which, thankfully, had the integrity and honesty to return the equipment to me…. albeit with missing parts which had found a way out of the packaging at some point en route. wex were advised of this and following exchanges of emails i was assured all the missing parts, with the exception of the original documents, would be replaced and i assumed the replacements would be of the same condition as the original parts… which i had rated at 9. the replacements received…two batteries and charger… one battery was an older model than my original, showed full life and was ok cosmetically. the other battery showed a medium life and and had clearly seen rough handling with multiple areas of surface damage and heavy scratching to the casing and terminals. the charger had clearly experienced a similar life, heavy marking, peeling sticker, missing the chamber covers and in a generally dirty state, which might have been offset by a quick clean up before posting out. the manual which i had been promised was not included. again i contacted wex to express my disappointment at the state of the replacements and was advised they were the only items available. it would have been courteous of wex to have advised of this before posting out… another failure of communication. as matters had not, earlier, been clear as to whether or not the original missing parts would be returned etc, i exited the trade-in with a view i would return once matters had been resolved and assuming, wrongly so, the trade in offer would be equivalent to the original offer. the next trade-in offer was £32. 00 less but i still accepted… i was later, however, assured the original offer would stand and the camera along with the replacement parts provided by wex were sent off. when the final offer came through it was not the original offer which i had been assured would be reinstated, but the lesser offer. by this point i had just about had enough and accepted the offer to see the back of this business dealing. the camera which i have since bought is every bit as described in the wex advert and although i have not yet had chance to fully try it out. all seems to be well and i am very pleased. it was advertised as having a manual but arrived without one… i advised wex and was informed if one could be found it would be forwarded to me. i have not heard anything so i assume one is not available. i have been trading with wex for many years and this experience is not the high quality experience to which i have become accustomed…. hence only 2.",Neutral,"{'Product', 'Packaging', 'Delivery', 'Electronics'}","The review appears legitimate, with a detailed account of the customer's issues with Wex's trade-in process and replacement parts. No specific electronics model is mentioned."
5,Trustpilot,2,i wanted a case for my sony rx10 which would fit neatly into a cycle touring bar bag. i was uncertain about sizing and phoned customer service. jonathan was tremendously helpful. he understood my somewhat unusual requirement and very patiently worked through options. the final choice was on the margins but jonathan thought it might just work. and it is absolutely perfect. the camera just fits and no more. that is what i call true customer service. thank you!,Positive,"{'Electronics', 'Customer service'}","The review seems genuine, and I found no issues with it.
