I requested that they return the rejected items - and this did not go at all smoothly.  I was expecting to receive the returned items together with the new items that I purchased, as part of the part-exchange deal.  I had to phone a couple of times to get the equipment returned.  Amongst the items were a couple of lenses, which were missing the lens hoods.  I phoned to ask them to return the lens hoods.  A couple of days later I received a package - containing lens hoods, but not the lens hoods I had sent them.  I don't know whose lens hoods they were, but they certainly weren't mine.  So I phoned them again to ask for my original lens hoods back.  The person I spoke to insisted that the mistake was not at their end - if the lenses I had sent had lens hoods, these would have been returned together with the lenses. In the end they found my lens hoods, and returned them to me.

The email I recieved back was very short and didn't give me much reassurance. It has been 3 days now since I recieved my telescope, and unfortunately I have had nothing but fog and thick clouds, so haven't really had the chance to check if everything is ok with the optics and mirror. On my receipt it says if anything is wrong with my item, to contact them within 48 hours of receiving it, which I am sceptical about since more time has passed than that without me being able to check everything out, and also I had to bin most of the packaging due to it taking up space.

Yes it was free of scratches, but no it wasn't clean, or free of dust.

First attempt, the wrong product was delivered. I am of an age where camouflage as an outer coating on anything is not what I want. Contact was made with Wex and though offered the opportunity to pay the extra for the """"camo"""" (politely declined), the appropriate return labels etc. arrived quickly. Followed by 3/4 of an hour out of my day going to the post office. The replacement arrived a week after the first delivery.

Same returns process - very efficient, but another 45 minutes out of my life meeting the lovely people at the post office. Third time lucky, the bins arrived. Yes they work, yes they are as ordered. But only two weeks later than anticipated. Other than being offered my money back or a replacement, no sort of apology for the poor service.

As a first time customer, I emailed to ask for reassurance that my item was in stock, as I noticed after I placed my order that it said out of stock, however I did suspect that it was because I had ordered the last one im stock. The email I recieved back was very short and didn't give me much reassurance. It has been 3 days now since I recieved my telescope, and unfortunately I have had nothing but fog and thick clouds, so haven't really had the chance to check if everything is ok with the optics and mirror. On my receipt it says if anything is wrong with my item, to contact them within 48 hours of receiving it, which I am sceptical about since more time has passed than that without me being able to check everything out, and also I had to bin most of the packaging due to it taking up space.

This was extremely inconvenient as I had to wait in to receive it and I had suggested a credit for the delivery charge but that didn't happen.
