Great equipment but let down once again by delivery issues!,"I ordered a lens with Sunday delivery, but it didn't arrive. Once again, DPD reported an issue. I understand this is beyond Wex's control, but I'm losing confidence in ordering from you. I'd prefer to shop where DPD is not the preferred delivery company so I can receive my items as expected. To make matters worse, I received an email the next day thanking me for my support!",2024-06-09T00:00:00Z,2024-06-10T09:28:57Z,2,Nigel Witts,,9

A measure of how good a company is,"A measure of how good a company is, is how well it handles issues. Having retuned a faulty camera, which was well handled. Customer service decided to apply a refund to may card instead of applying it to my account (as instructed). Which meant the replacement wouldn’t be released until I paid for the replacement. Refund takes up to 7 days. After called customer services it was a case of “computer says no” to trying to sort the issue out.",2024-04-29T00:00:00Z,2024-05-05T10:39:34Z,2,Peter Lethbridge,,11

The trade in and purchase didn't go smoothly,"The trade in and purchase really didn't go well with bad communication and failure to do as they had promised. I really don't think the Trade in process has got easier as they'd advertised. I have used them many times before and it had always gone well in the past. Hopefully a one off.
After speaking to Wex they explained the situation and did their best to put things right for me which was much appreciated. ",2024-04-03T00:00:00Z,2024-04-09T09:32:31Z,2,Stephen Bassett,,4
Be very cautious when part exchanging,"After years of using WEX and many thousands spent, I recently had a very poor experience when part exchanging camera gear with WEX.  I’m only posting this review as despite me giving them every chance to privately respond to my complaint, I’ve heard nothing back.
Among the gear sent in to WEX was a camera body.  I subsequently heard back from WEX who said that despite trying it with several flash guns, the body would not trigger a flash.  This was very surprising as I used external flash pretty regularly with the camera, however I had to take their word for it as the camera was with them at the other end of the country.
They offered to get a quote for repair (the cost of which would come off the quoted part-ex value) and I asked them to go ahead with the repair quote.  The quote arrived minutes later and was for approximately £270 to include ‘labour, replacement of parts, calibration and testing’.  As this would leave me with about £10 part-ex value, I asked them to send it back to me.
When it arrived, I noticed that the hotshoe contacts looked a little dirty so I wiped them with an alcohol wipe, fitted a flash and it fired perfectly. I subsequently tried several other flashguns and they all worked fine.
I can’t believe that any technician inspecting a camera wouldn’t think to clean the hotshoe if a flash didn’t fire and where did the £270 quote come from? If I hadn’t asked for it back and had left it with WEX for repair, I’d have paid £270 for someone to clean the hotshoe and would have been oblivious. It would have needed no ‘parts or calibration’ so I can’t understand how they arrived at the quote.
This whole experience has left me vary wary of the WEX part exchange process and I doubt I’ll be able to trust them in future.",2024-03-18T00:00:00Z,2024-03-29T11:23:34Z,2,MR WETHERILL,,16
Not the usual very high standard expected.,"This review is being submitted as Wex regularly invite me to do so, otherwise I would not recant the story behind this purchase.

Reviews are only of value if there is something which might be learned for the benefit of customers and for the supplier, if the review is objective, balanced, truthful and can be supported by quite reasonable evidence.

The purchase of this recent camera was preceded by a trade -in to part fund the purchase of this model when one became available at a future date… which came about soon after.

A price ( subject to inspection ) was agreed and DPD collected my equipment on time and the following day I received a message from Wex to advise my equipment had been received and would be valued within 2-5 working days.

A week went by without further communication from Wex so I messaged to enquire of the progress.

The response indicated Wex had not in fact received my camera but a KETTLE in its place ( like a sketch we might see in an episode of The Two Ronnies ).

No-one had informed me about this and it seems DPD were conducting a search to try to locate the lost package…. poor communication.

In the message received, the kettle mentioned had a brand name which minded me of a delivery we had received a few days earlier which, because it was not addressed to me, was assumed to contain items for the greenhouse which were expected that same day.. the postal label had the same brand name printed.

On opening the package I found some of the items I had forwarded to Wex… the camera body, the strap and AV leads, which appeared to be undisturbed in the lower chamber of the box.

However, the battery, battery charger, manual, assorted point of original sale documents and the covering letter of inventory were all missing… these had been secured in a sealed plastic wallet in the upper chamber.

It seems DPD had delivered my equipment to a company in London which, thankfully, had the integrity and honesty to return the equipment to me…. albeit with missing parts which had found a way out of the packaging at some point en route.

Wex were advised of this and following exchanges of emails I was assured all the missing parts, with the exception of the original documents, would be replaced and I assumed the replacements would be of the same condition as the original parts… which I had rated at 9.

The replacements received…two batteries and charger… one battery was an older model than my original, showed full life and was ok cosmetically. The other battery showed a medium life and and had clearly seen rough handling with multiple areas of surface damage and heavy scratching to the casing and terminals. The charger had clearly experienced a similar life, heavy marking, peeling sticker, missing the chamber covers and in a generally dirty state, which might have been offset by a quick clean up before posting out.

The manual which I had been promised was not included.

Again I contacted Wex to express my disappointment at the state of the replacements and was advised they were the only items available.

It would have been courteous of Wex to have advised of this before posting out… another failure of communication.

As matters had not, earlier, been clear as to whether or not the original missing parts would be returned etc, I exited the trade-in with a view I would return once matters had been resolved and assuming, wrongly so, the trade in offer would be equivalent to the original offer.

The next trade-in offer was £32.00 less but I still accepted… I was later, however, assured the original offer would stand and the camera along with the replacement parts provided by Wex were sent off.

When the final offer came through it was not the original offer which I had been assured would be reinstated, but the lesser offer.

By this point I had just about had enough and accepted the offer to see the back of this business dealing.

The camera which I have since bought is every bit as described in the Wex advert and although I haven’t yet had chance to fully try it out.. all seems to be well and I am very pleased.

It was advertised as having a manual but arrived without one… I advised Wex and was informed if one could be found it would be forwarded to me. I haven’t heard anything so I assume one isn’t available.

I have been trading with Wex for many years and this experience is not the high quality experience to which I have become accustomed…. hence only 2*.",2024-03-14T00:00:00Z,2024-03-25T23:01:40Z,2,Vincent Ellis,,28

My first and last purchase,"My first and last purchase, ordered a new R6 and lens. Never got an order confirmation for the camera body. Lens arrived no body. Called them, oh sorry we don’t actually have it in stock. Spent an hour then looking into the R6 mark II and getting a deal; about to pay - then Oh we found your R6, they shipped it! The whole call took an hour and a half and I nearly lost the will to live! So much so I’m considering sending the whole order back as I wonder how bad the after care will be! Better off heading to Canon given the pricing isn’t too far off. 

Stars updated to two from one following a good response from Wex below and on email to me. 2 stars is still as good as it gets based on my experience Wex. Please do better. 

Thanks! Rachel",2024-02-29T00:00:00Z,2024-03-06T15:54:27Z,2,Rachel Royal,,13
Don't bother with Warranty,"I bought an A7S III from this company, £2300 in total.

I purchased from this site specifically for the ""12 month warranty guarantee"", what they fail to tell you, is if they provide a faulty item that they take it away for 4 weeks for repair.

I do filming full time as a career, it is my lively hood.

I need my camera to do work, I discovered the HDMI port was faulty within the 12 month time frame - emailed their customer service, for them to advise they would need the camera for 4 weeks minimum.

I explained I need a camera for work, and if there was a possible workaround, like providing a replacement/lending a replacement.

They said I am able to rent a camera, which I would be happy to do if it wasn't expensive, understanding that they probably have a few cases to deal with.

£700 to rent a camera at a similar spec, for a month.

£700 to provide a replacement, for a camera they sent out which was faulty.

I can work around not using the HDMI port, obviously very not ideal but will have to make do. I would of thought they do extensive testing to make sure the camera body works.

Unfortunately leaving them a bad review, as the customer service was poor - Twisting it to say I could have done it back in August - Even though it is a 12-month warranty service.

I understand they can provide a repair, but I don't understand the long wait time / expensive temporary replacement for an issue on their end.",2024-02-22T00:00:00Z,2024-02-22T17:02:02Z,2,Oscar Sale,,3
The lens I bought is as described,"The lens I bought is as described - happy enough with that.
I am very lucky to have got it though as the delivery company did not leave it at my chosen alternative on the next day (premium) delivery; neither did they on the following day - they simply ""dumped"" it on a chair in the rain outside my neighbour's kitchen in full view of the passing public.",2024-02-05T00:00:00Z,2024-02-11T10:13:19Z,2,"Peter, Leven, Fife.",,1
Shambolic Delivery,"The Wex staff were very helpful but that goes to nought when  the delivery was such a shambles.  It was supposed to be next day but was not. DPD came several times but did not drop off. We changed the drop off to a safe location which was confirmed but DPD who came again but did not drop off. I called Wex and the delivery was changed to the nearest drop off point for the next day and was delivered 48 hours later, 24 hours late, and now a couple of days after picking up the parcel I have received my DPD pick up pass. Useless.

I have used Wex and Fixation a lot over the years and I think this was exceptional and really the transporter's fault. I shall continue to use Wex who I think are generally very efficient.",2024-01-24T00:00:00Z,2024-02-04T13:31:51Z,2,James Forshall,,5
Repeated on line ordering error.,"WEX staff are very helpful when you talk to a person, however there’s a long standing issue within the online order system, where it believes a Uk address is actually an overseas address and fails to process your order. This is frustrating when taking the time to populate all the details, but more so if you have set up alerting on used equipment items that only become available very infrequently, as it should be possible to order online out of ours when alerted, but due to this issue you cannot, and I’ve missed items as a result that I had been waiting to become in stock to purchase.",2024-01-04T00:00:00Z,2024-01-10T10:28:05Z,2,Brian Hammond,,7

Don't trade in when it's cold weather,"I bought a Fujifilm X-T5 and sent my mint condition X-S10 and 23mm lens to them for trade in. I bought the X-T5 outright as they told me they'd send me the trade-in cash separately. Days later they said the X-T5 had a faulty dial, that the hot shoe cover was missing, and that the 23mm lens has moisture problems, and they want hundreds to repair the camera and lens. I refused as I knew the camera was mint and that the lens was super sharp, i.e. no moisture and always stored in a box with silica gel. Also, I know I sent them the hot shoe cover as I had kept it in the original box! I asked them to send them back. I checked them when they arrived - both were stone cold with no protection form the icy weather apart from the carboard box, so I had to immediately wrap both items securely with silica gel packs to get rid of the moisture. I suggested to WEX that the moisture problem they saw with my lens was caused during transit to them but they refused to believe this. The face that both of my items returned stone cold and immediately got moisture on them when opened in my warm house suggests otherwise. So, beware of sending trade-ins to WEX during cold weather as the courier takes several days and is not protected from the elements. I have no idea why they thought one of the controls was faulty - I can only imagine it seized up temporarily during the courier transport.",2023-11-23T00:00:00Z,2023-12-23T16:38:34Z,2,customer,,5
I was seriously looking to buy but...,"I recently visited the Wex showrooms near Whitechapel with a (male) friend. I am replacing my Canon EOS 7D with the R7 Mirrorless version. Whilst I was initially shown the camera, I also explained that I had brought an EF lens with me to try (my friend said Wex were great at letting you try things, which they seem to be) so that I could see for myself how the adaptor worked and fitted compared to R fit lenses. I had assumed that they had an adaptor as the website implied they were in stock (I know there can be a difference). Anyway, after the initial brief chat with me the gentleman went back to his till post, and started chatting with someone else (from the shop) and seemed to be doing something on a phone (as we all do), my friend was happily engaged in a chat with another store colleague looking at a lens for his camera, they were chatting happily and I interrupted them briefly to ask a question. I was then ignored. The chap at the till was happily chatting to his colleague, me standing looking at him, (it was close by) waiting for a break in their conversation. Eventually I was able to attract their attention and asked I asked whether they could supply an adaptor that I could try my lens with and he came back and said they didn't have one. I asked if they had a 2nd hand body but they didn't. I also asked another question about lenses for the mirrorless Canons, and received a rather waffly, brief and somewhat dismissive reply. No sense of engagement whatsoever.

I was definitely open to buying that camera body that day, however the almost complete lack of interest shown to me meant I didn't. To quote Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman when she was treated poorly in a shop ""...big mistake, huge"". You missed a £1500 sale because I was not taken for a serious purchaser. My friend did not have to solicit attention, and maybe the staff thought he was the serious purchaser and not me, wrong way around, we were at the shop for ME to buy, he just happened to want a look at another lens. Was it because I was female and over 60? I sincerely hope not, but I shan't be gracing Wex with my custom. My friend was also appalled. He'll probably still buy from there as he was treated well. Hopefully a one off aberration.  The shop was empty apart from us, in case anyone thinks the staff were busy selling.",2023-12-19T00:00:00Z,2023-12-21T18:57:56Z,2,Mrs S J Mears,,15

Claimed my trade in lens was damaged,"Wanted to trade in my camera and lens at the Edinburgh store for credit.

First they wouldn't take my camera as it had apparently reached it's shutter count lifespan, but they were happy to take the lens. Without the camera though I decided to opt for cash on the lens instead of store credit for both like I'd initially wanted.

To do this they had to send the lens to their Norwich office for another inspection. Wex packaged it up and sent it off then a few days later the Norwich team email to say the lens has ""moisture"" inside and would be too expensive to fix, so did I want them to just dispose of it. Of course not, it was a perfectly good lens and the Edinburgh store had found no issue with it! When I questioned them on this I just got blunt, short replies from the Norwich team refusing any responsibility or offering any explanations as to why the Edinburgh team missed this apparent issue, or how the moisture had got in there between me handing it to them and it arriving in Norwich.

I received the lens back and inspected it myself finding no such issue, so instead I sold both camera and lens to MPB who took them without issue.",2023-11-22T00:00:00Z,2023-12-10T18:55:17Z,2,Simon,,7
Not the product I was promised & not impressive customer service,"I have been their customer for many years, I am a professional and have always bought my kit from Wex.  

The last few purchases have been disappointing to be honest,  one was a second hand item which was not as it was listed (wrong product code) so I had to return it.  

Last week again, despite the customer service confirmed with me the product code before I placed the order, I received a goods that had a different product code, with different (lesser) spec. They refused to admit they made a mistake with a strange explanation, they didn't sound that apologetic and I wasted my time, ordering it from someone else at a cheaper price and having to return this one to Wex.  

Not impressed and sad as I don't feel confident buying from them anymore.  It used to be my go-to shop.",2023-11-21T00:00:00Z,2023-11-27T13:21:28Z,2,customer Y,,6

"Multiple mistakes over two orders, trying to get a single item.","Somehow I was able to order a USED item that was 'out of stock'. Phoned and cancelled the order.

It was fine but that's not the point (technically that was Parcelforce, not WEX, but if you use them, they represent your company).
Anyway, item received was the wrong model.

After phoning again, they'd replace it, but then the return process was some archaic bs where I'd have to seek out and pay a printers (seriously, who owns a printer in 2023? They're one of the most ridiculous ripoff items a regular person can own) and label up the package myself and go to the post office.

Consider taking a look how MPB operate (I'd had to return something to them just two weeks before) -- a dream.

Disappointing trade-in deal,"I have been buying kit from Wex for years and have always been happy with their pricing and service. Indeed I have just spent over £2k on a new Fujifilm X-T5 and lenses. I didn't often do trade-in/buy-for-cash deals with them as their offers on my kit were usually not competitive. However, this time I got quotes from Wex which were really competitive - until I sent them the kit, most of which I purchased brand new from Wex 15 months ago and was little used. I was horrified to find the revised quotation to buy the kit back was below their initial quote, and for one lens, almost £100 below. I challenged their quote but they wouldn't budge. In the end I reluctantly accepted their offer on everything bar that one lens which they are now returning to me and I will sell to another dealer. Not a happy camper!

UPDATE: I have just heard back from Wex and they have offered me a £50 credit voucher, which I graciously accepted. A happier camper!",2023-08-14T00:00:00Z,2023-08-14T15:02:32Z,2,Mr Miller,,23

"Lens slightly worse than expected, delivery service atrocious","Wex uses Parcelforce which is a dreadful delivery service, as a result my item was dispatched early on a Thursday morning for a next-day order but didn't arrive until the following Tuesday, Parcelflunk missing both their original service date but also then not delivering on the next available working day - despite their tracker saying that they were. I had to stay in for three days waiting for the item, and missed a job as a result, and it was impossible to speak to Parcelflunk. Wex gave me a voucher as an apology which was appreciated. Parcelflunk did not, they just sent me an excuse.

The item itself, a lens Sigma 65mm f2, seems very sharp and well built, though i haven't been on a job with it yet. Early indications are of chromatic aberration at f2 which is a bit disappointing also, as reviews suggested it was optically perfect.",2023-07-17T00:00:00Z,2023-07-29T12:59:39Z,2,Stuart Ryder,,8

Thankyou Wex for the speedy response.

Maybe I’ve been unfortunate.,"Online order worked well. However, I bought from them for the next day delivery. Item packed and sent prompt, but to wrong delivery centre. I knew it would never then be delivered next day as I required. Contact with Wex was below expectation. I still not sure if it was just an AI Bot or human. All one line statements and generic - typical AI bot. They started by telling me what I told them that delivery went awry but as if it was informing and helpful to me!! Really. No option, but to wait ….. estimate now five days. Courier actually had it local to me next day but wouldn’t deliver as Wex hadn’t request it to be expedited. I could have had it on day 2, but no I wasn’t given that option, couldn’t request direct with courier, and Wex were obviously not interested in a quick delivery as they just stated it would be 5 days. A 5 day delivery (don’t work Sunday, and holiday Mon) is not good or caring service for advertised next day; made worse by I could have had it in 48 hrs if Wex wanted and the dealing with what I assume was a Bot. If it was a human it was a very stand off uninvolved reply.
Not the first problems over the years with Wex - locked car park during opening hours so couldn’t get in, a demonstration day ceased earlier than advertised so too late, etc.
There are much better companies to deal with, but maybe I’ve just been unlucky with my dealings.",2023-05-03T23:00:00Z,2023-05-16T09:38:56Z,2,Out and about.,,2

Faulty 'like-new' Swarovski binoculars,"Purchased 'out of box' like- new premium Swarovski used binoculars. When they arrived there was a serious optical flaw (left and right images would not align making them useless as a binocular in spite of the quality of the make) that indicated Wex had not bothered to examine the binoculars both when they took them back from the first owner and then when they shipped them to me. That kind of fault usually means the binoculars have had a hard thump, so hardly 'like-new'. Staff were helpful, refund went smoothly but
no recognition or acknowledgment that they had missed a major fault in a pair of high spec binoculars.

After various emails and 2 phone calls and a promise the credit would be in my account this morning ,what did I get just an email saying I still had 7 days to make up my mind for the original offer.
I have even bought things for my new camera like an L bracket and a case ( ok a little presumptuous )
I finally had enough of waiting and hearing things like we are extremely busy right now ? oh ok isn't that what shops are wanting as clearly you don't appear to want to end this simply by adding some digits to a column and taking even more money from me .
Thank you James,John and Jack not forgetting Claire and others who all seem to have palmed me off .

While the representatives in contact were well mannered, they were replying for each others queries (there were a total of 4 different people) with clear lack of communication and misunderstanding of previous conversations, leading to multiple mishaps, where after a week of conversing, it was agreed upon to provide a replacement model instead. The length of the messy and drawn out string of events subsequently disrupted my photography and videography, with it being my primary camera.

No apology, no ""sorry there was glitch on the website"" - sounds like it happens all the time with WEX online orders and he was fed up with telling yet another customer the same thing, or maybe he just couldn't care - who knows?

I phoned them up only to be told that the mix up was caused because the card reader did read SD cards which the camera also uses. I thought that it would be obvious that I would want a card reader that reads the type of card that I had been sold. Anyway did another 100 mile round trip to Bristol and back the same day to pick up another card reader. This cost substantially more, but to be fair, they gave me 10% discount. Although I have dealt with Wex online quite a few times with no problems, I was not impressed with the service I got from its Bristol store. I think that this is a real shame as it is great to see ‘proper’ shops trading again, although I will probably stick with online shopping as far as Wex is concerned.",,2022-08-07T17:11:06Z,2,Hec,,1

Unfortunatley I may have been a bit premature with my last review.,"I recently gave Wex a review of 4 starts, 4 days ago having finally received my order- or so I thought. I now have to review that grading. My order was for a DJI drone, a fly more kit and a DJI protection scheme (called a care refresh code) . I received the physical parts as stated, but not anything re the product protection. When I realised this I contacted Wex to be told that a code should have been emailed to me and now it was no longer in stock. It was at this point they reminded that if I activated the drone I only had 48 hours to register the product protection or it would be lost , that is the £119 I paid for it would be down the drain ! Luckily I hadn't activated the drone and now I'm in a situation where I have a drone but can't fly it, because I can't activate it as I have no way of registering it AND the staff at Wex cannot give me any idea of when the codes will next be available. It's shocking that they didn't emphasise this at the time of sending out the physical elements - I could have easily gone ahead and prepared the drone  and in so doing have voided the warranty they have yet to send me.  That potentially, could have been an easily avoided expensive mistake.",,2022-07-19T13:54:26Z,2,shaun robinson,,7

Tail end of last year they delivered my Fujifilm X100V to the wrong house. Wex eventually found out where it had gone to but I had to go and retrieve it from where it was delivered to as PF didn’t want to know. 

Ordered three lenses. Should have been here between 2-3 yesterday. Never showed. Tracking stopped working at 4. Was told it should be here today but still a no show. 

Someone from Wex was supposed to get back to me today to find out where it’s gone but no info. 

Doubt they’ll get delivered or I’ll hear anything before Monday now.

Last year when buying an expensive camera it did not arrive when expected and when it turned up days late I just found it deposited on my doorstep. My most recent purchase (just arrived) eventually turned up in very battered packaging a week late. Wex customer services were helpful and offered a £25 good will refund.

Camera returned filthy from a trade in,"Took a camera in for trade in, based on a reasonable offer of £222 cash. Chose Wex as I live very close and have used them for years (since my Canon 10D). The chap in store was awesome, a credit to Wex. Helped me with the return, and then helped me get shop for what I was going to buy. I was told the assessment wasn't done there though, so I needed to wait for it to go to be assessed which would take a few days. Also, I was told it wasn't cash but vouchers only, a pain, but fine I was going to spend it all in store anyway (at full RRP, I should add, not internet prices).

Turns out that they do assess in store, so I was just being given the runaround, and when the quote came back it was £181 because of some ""screen delamination"". Nice for them to also send an acceptance form, so I guess this is simply what they do to lowball you once you've left the store.

Cancelled my trade in, and my £200 order and will take it to a different store that has already offered me £203 cash.

I've literally spend tens of thousands with Wex, and was going to pour the trade in straight back into store. Not anymore. The only reason I didn't spend £1799 on the new camera kit I wanted there was because Wex doesn't have stock and wasn't able to tell me when it was going to be in stock. Ironically, if they'd offered me a used camera and lens I would have accepted it at the retail price I managed to import the camera at (£300 cheaper than Wex).

I'm genuinely disappointed I can't use my local camera store anymore.

Edit: just got my camera back and it's absolutely covered in white powder. It's everywhere, including the optics. I guess that was revenge for not accepting their ""offer"".

Edit #2: I remembered that I was also super understanding and helpful when another customer interrupted my conversation with the employee who was serving me.

I had a nightmare this time using WEX…,"I had a nightmare this time using WEX Leeds. I purchased a canon R5 and Capture One pro on black friday 2021 and spent a considerable amount of money there. Firstly they charged me for the full price of capture and I only noticed days later, when the promotion was not on anymore and they couldn't access the past promotion to check how much to refund me. They did it in the end, thankfully . It took 9 days for me to actually receive my Capture One and I only did because I called everyday (more than once) requesting updates. I received a lot of ""leave it with me"" type of answers which sometimes felt like the staff just wanted to hang up and get on with their day, as nothing really was resolved. On day 7 I got a serial key on the body of an email straight from the manager (which was unusual) and this key already belonged to someone (as capture one support informed me) , the same  happened the next day. 
The staff was polite throughout but completely clueless about how and when I would get capture. (One guy said that maybe it was being posted, when is logically a digital product)
The young staff that sold me the goods also told me that by buying capture one I would be able to upgrade to the next version of capture one (coming the following weeks) it turned out not to be true, I found out. (CORRECTION) -I apologise about this part as I managed to use the code for C1 22 now. -
The whole incident gave me a lot of stress and anxiety and also affected my business as I couldn't use my New Canon R5 in jobs that week, because it was not recognized by the older version of Capture one I had. 
I tried reaching out to WEX headquarters via social media and was blatantly ignored. 
I had nicer experiences in the past using WEX Manchester but the Leeds branch really let me down.

"Hello,","Hello,

Whist the delivery was timely, I was not given any indiction of when my parcel would be on the way - it just arrived without a Text message or email advising me of the delivery time.  Fortunately, my neighbour was home at the time the courier arrived.

Secondly, I ordered a soft, quilted wrap designed to protect camera equipment - a flat soft package.  This arrived in a medium-sized box, with plastic air wrap which is used to protect delicate goods - WHY?  A large padded envelope would have been more than adequate for delivery.  
As Britain is trying to cut down on single-use plastic, why add to the tsunami of plastic waste with such a needless packaging.  I am quite distressed about it ... it was totally unnecessary and totally environmentally unfriendly.

Poor customer service,"Poor customer service - confusion and disappointment. This company is probably ok for in-stock items however I had a horrible experience on a back order item. Having waited four months for a battery on backorder I received an email to say my order had been cancelled. I immediately queried this and it was explained that the item had arrived in stock, but because I hadn’t paid the order was cancelled. I had provided my card details when I placed the order and the resulting pdf invoice was clearly marked as paid. I offered to make payment and was told that my item had been allocated to another customer (this was within 30 mins of me receiving the cancellation email) and that I would had to re order (the item was out of stock).

"Good product, poor customer service & delivery arrangements","Ordered item at weekend, and requested (and paid for) specified day delivery, expecting this to arrive Monday.  Received notification that delivery would be by FedEx on Wednesday.  Contacted Customer Services who told me I had selected FedEx, and could not be persuaded otherwise.  In fact, the only delivery options available to select on the website are:
1. Free standard delivery
2. Next or named working day (selected)
3. Saturday.
Nowhere is there an option to choose the courier, and I would certainly never have chosen to pay extra for a 3 day service.  Clearly the Customer Service agent (Claire) is unaware of the website options, and refused to believe that occasionally the customer is right - even in the face of photographic evidence!

Dispatch and delivery services need reviewing.,"I ordered photographic equipment online, which was straightforward and easy to do. The problem lies with the dispatch and delivery services. My order was for 2 items, a new camera and 100-500mm lens, a total spend of a little over £7,000. There was insufficient packaging around the items, placed in a box without care instructions, ‘FRAGILE’ and/or ‘HANDLE WITH CARE’ would have been expected at least. Furthermore it was delivered by Parcel Force, who left it on the door step, without the need for a photo proof of delivery, when the door is opened.

It was one of the clearest examples of ignoring our need to cut waste I've ever seen.

And in addition to that, the flat box of paper was right at the bottom of the huge box anyway, so all that packaging was totally pointless.

I am now very much actively looking for an alternative supplier of printing paper, which is a shame as I’ve bought many items from Wex over the years.

second hand from you again. You might have a word with your employee who inspected the lens and instruct him how not to screw an end cap as tight as it will go and how to clean a lens to a saleable condition. Thank You!",,2020-12-04T11:55:30Z,2,Stephen Nurthen,,2

Beware before you buy!,"With a very few exceptions, cameras come with chargers included and this one certainly did when new (I checked). The charger had not been specifically listed as being included but neither had the camera. As an intrinsic part of the camera, I think specific reference should have been made to it not being there. When my used camera arrived without charger I was forced to buy a used charger from them thus inflating the price, decreasing my impression of the company and generally making me feel somewhat irritated. Despite numerous emails to and from WEX customer services the most I got was scarcely believable reasons, waffle and in the end just £10 off the charger I was made to buy as an extra. I wouldn't have minded if the camera in question didn't normally come with a charger, but it did. I remain inclined to shop elsewhere next time.

I had a spare tatty 3rd party so not too fussed. Then 2 weeks later, within 35 days it developed a fault. Called up, really unhelpful said it had to go for repair. Checked with the repair company fixation and they dont repair this fault and it would have to go back to Fuji meaning 4-6 weeks. Longer than I had the camera. Phoned up again and managed to get it credited although they wouldn't swap over as none as grade 8 yet based on poor service you'd think they'd help me out. Anyway I got credited (the only reason for the extra star as that agent was helpful). Ordered a fuji xt100 in box grade 9. Didn't come with an official battery and an incomplete charger yet again even though clearly stated it comes with official bits. This was returned. I wish I could use my credit to buy something, unfortunately wex are clearly falling behind on the trade in front and basically have no new used stock. Asked to change credit to cash (like clifton cameras and park cameras do) and was told I cannot. Suffice to say I'll be holding my breath until something comes into stock. Hopefully 3rd time lucky but feel I want money ASAP as the way wex are going I wouldn't see them surviving too much longer and my credit is worth nothing",,2020-07-13T16:08:57Z,2,Ben Bull,,7
Basic service fine,"Basic service fine, but poor approach to customer service.

Ref reply below: I did supply a list and the answer was ‘no discount’ on any of the accessories unless I bought them all plus two  more lenses!  See reply from Martin of your customer services on 24 June at 4:27.

Ref further reply: this exchange kind of proves my point. I spent a lot of money on a new camera and an expensive lens and I wondered if I might get a discount on an extra battery and charger and some other bits, and I might even have bought another lens. But rather than Wex just making a small gesture of goodwill, I had to list out all the things I might be considering buying only to be told ‘no discount‘. These aren’t the first purchases I’ve made from Wex, and nor would they have been the last if I’d felt like a valued customer, but now I just feel really cheesed off and will go elsewhere in future.",,2020-07-09T09:25:49Z,2,Emma Tarran,,4

Bad experience but resolved,"Over the years I have spent thousands of pounds with Wex. At the beginning of March I placed an order, the final item of which has just arrived over three months later. The delays were due to suppliers and carriers but I am most disappointed with their customer service. Communication; email and especially phone calls and live chat were at best indifferent at worst defensive and aggressive, each time making me feel more frustrated. Having worked in photographic retail, if I had dealt with customers like that, I would have expected many complaints. After this experience I will be spending my money elsewhere. Very disappointed.

Update: Wex asked me to contact them about my complaint. They took my issues seriously and gave me a generous gesture of goodwill. I am happy to accept and hope that this was an isolated incident and will probably give them another try.",,2020-06-19T12:28:51Z,2,Rachel,,1

Asked to speak with the manager who began to argue and stand up for the salesperson. I just wanted an apology for the inconvenience and a timeframe (there is none!). Her tone was horrible and argumentative. So fed up with the conversation I asked for a refund and the woman manager said FINE!  and hung up on me.  Really Wex?

Warehouse service poor; Having received my last order with it's exterior box damaged (possibly no fault to WEX), I was a little apprehensive about the inside. As I spend the box it was plain to see that the packaging was of a very poor standard. The two items; lens, and Nikon battery pack were unprotected at the bottom of the box with packing on top rather than around the items. The result of this was that the battery pack box is very damaged. Luckily the battery pack wasn't.

To be honest how would you rate…,"To be honest how would you rate yourselves? That's the question I'll start with and end with for the review. 

I'm going to be honest, we are in an unprecedented time right now; businesses are having to adapt and there's going to be teething pains. It is clear to me that WEX for the most part for the majority of customers has still been able to provide a wonderful service and it was partly the reason I choose to do business with themselves. In the past I brought a Sony Alpha A7 from yourselves back in 2017 and I had no issues with that purchase. So I decided that for my next camera I'd buy it from yourselves and because my pay was gonna be a little late I decided to finance it. 

I was very much looking forward to it arriving until I realised the charger wasn't in the box. No matter I spoke to one of your representatives who though was distracted in our chat sent out a battery charger which I received on the Saturday. I charged the camera and got to using it very quickly, which was when I realised there was a fault with camera. So I thought no matter I'll record a few videos and contact the support over WhatsApp on the Monday and get this resolved... Well it didn't get resolved the response I got on WhatsApp was well that's how cameras work. Which felt dismissive and didn't even seem concerned that a customer was having trouble yet they'd sent 3 videos showing a problem with the camera at this point. So I decided to try the live chat on the Tuesday explaining the situation which just told me to send an email. I waited a day and didn't get a response so I rang and felt like I was getting somewhere they apologised and the camera was collected. The email I sent the day before was responded to 10 minutes after the call. To which I replied and just said I'd called yourselves and just said what I had been told on the phone. To which later that day I received an email saying the camera repair would take 4 to 6 weeks. Now that's weird given I had the camera less than 5 days and it was faulty regardless of the condition. To which I was taken a back that there wouldn't be anything else which kinda contradicted the call that I would discuss it with them once they had the camera. I was really infuriated that I'd essentially paid for a placeholder and that I'd start paying for a camera that I might not actually have. I asked wasn't there anything you could do given the circumstances of what has happened. Nothing. Barclays seemed to agree with me that I shouldn't pay for a camera I don't have. Yeah I have lenses from WEX but no camera to use them on.

I will admit I can sometimes write confusing sentences but that doesn't take away multiple people have responded in this chain, yet I've had different responses and it doesn't feel like anyone genuinely is concerned other than when I called in. 

It is funny I have 3 lenses and a flash now, for a camera that I don't have. If it's that big of an issue sourcing/sorting the Canon EOS M5 I originally brought why not at this point let's call it even and swap to a new Canon EOS M50 regardless of your policy we could go from there.

So yeah I sit here finding it weird that a company that hasn't made it clear what is happening with this order. Then sending an email to myself asking me to review them when I sit here with no camera and no clear indication on what's going to happen.

So how would you rate yourselves?",,2020-05-18T15:29:53Z,2,Thomas Griffiths,,1

A seporate order (made on the same day) from a different photography outlet arrived on time, thanks to DPD.
WEX let themselves down by choosing to use Parcelforce. It hardly encourages me to buy my next item from them.

In responce to Amanda's reply, thank you for the refund of postage costs, much appreciated. The issue of delivery remails however, perhaps WEX could add other couriers as an alternative to Parcelforce so that when ordering on-line, one can opt for something other than Parcelforce?

Something went wrong!,"Recently traded in some photo gear at Wex as I have done in the past.  Unfortunately on this occasion the experience was far from satisfactory, I had to chase the progress constantly and not once was I contacted when I was told I would be.  In my opinion the equipment I sent in for a trade-in was undervalued. I was told by the technician who evaluated my equipment the best place to store my camera gear at home was in the kitchen. When he told me there was a fault with my lenshe refused point blank to show me the problem. I honestly think I was duped and it's doubtful I will use WEX in the future which is a shame as in the past they have given very good service.  I'm not being bitter because my gear was undervalued but they were inconsistent in their explanations, generally unprofessional and communications from them were very poor. PART 2.... In response to your reply below. The lens was sent into Fixation previously under the warranty you supplied when I bought the lens from you earlier in that year.  I'm still not convinced there was moisture within the lens, it was never used in the rain and was stored when not being used in an appropriate way and not in a kitchen as your technician suggested was the best place, his comment still baffles me!  I'm still not happy about the situation as when I asked your technician if he could show me the problem with the lens he replied categorically that it would not be possible to show me, therefore I remain completely unhappy with the whole fiasco. The discount you gave me on the repair of the lens I feel is an insult.  Wex acted totally unprofessionally towards me and as I've spent significant sums with your company I am very disappointed .

Not only is this bad for the environment it also meant that it couldn't be posted thru the letter box which meant I had to pick it up. Was that from the normal royal mail pick up point, no. Was it from my local post office, no. It was from a random post office

Not a good experience!,"Not the greatest experience dealing with Wex. Bought a used Peak Design plate at a good price and paid via PayPal. Later that day I received an email saying if I still wanted the item it was in my basket. I got in touch through their automated system, querying this email. I received a reply saying they hadn't found a live order with my email address. I realised this was my error as I hadn't updated my email address whereupon I asked if it was possible to amend it. I was told they could do it and informed me they had done so. I still didn't receive an invoice so I had to dig out an old laptop and found they'd sent it still to the old email address. When I contacted them again to inform them of this they managed to update my email but sent me an invoice for another customer. I finally received the correct invoice but it left me disappointed at their level of competence. Make sure you check your invoices.",,2019-09-03T15:46:57Z,2,Trevor Litherland,,12

Disapointed with recent transaction,"I have been a customer of WEX for nine years and until a recent transaction have always awarded them 5 stars for service.However a recent deal with them which involved a trade in of equipment which I purchased new from them six months prior has left me extremely disappointed. The Fuji lens which came with the camera was inspected by Wex and reported to have moisture in it, which they advised was not covered by the warranty and would have to be sent to Fuji for repair(remember the equipment was purchased new 6 months previous). I was therefore charged £120 which included an out of warranty admin charge of £25. To add salt to the wound I was only allowed £10 for a Fuji grip which I had purchased at the same time as the camera for £75. Obviously my loyalty as a customer has little meaning any more and perhaps it is time to consider an alternative dealer for my future purchases.",,2019-08-24T10:56:33Z,2,slowswinger,,10

Surprisingly Poor Service,"I have used Wex for many years and have always been highly satisfied with their service. However, on this occasion I am very disappointed. I ordered two Benro products, a tripod head and a tripod head adaptor, at the same time in April. The tripod head adaptor was advertised as being necessary for use with certain types of tripod, which was necessary in my case. The tripod head was dispatched immediately and I was advised that the adaptor was out of stock but would be available in a few days. I then waited for over two months for the adaptor, which effectively meant the tripod head could not be used for that period despite the warranty running down on that product. I had to chase Wex a number of times to find an estimated delivery date, however the date kept going back due to problems with the supplier. I feel it is unethical selling a product which relies on a second product if it is known that there are going to be substantial delays in supply. Either Wex or Benro have badly let me down and I have not received an apology to date.",,2019-07-01T14:56:31Z,2,Steve,,9

Often it's the little things,"Ordinarily I'm used to giving Wex a solid 5 star rating. However on this occasion I'm forced to give only two, and one of those only because of the apologetic mail I received after reminding them that I had still not received the balance of my order 5 months after placing it.

Why didn't I just cancel the order and go somewhere else? I hear you say, and normally I'd agree, however ...principals...

After waiting for the first three months I had all but written it off anyway but was intrigued to find out if anyone pays attention, informs the customer and actively tracks the odd/low value items ( £14.98) which either don't make the minimum supplier re-order value for months or otherwise slip through the cracks. 
In my case...it seems, apparently not. I was patient.

Finally, as Winter changed to Spring and we headed for Easter still no sign, so I concluded that I'd better mention it...So I did...

Anyway, I felt compassion for the same service rep (Hence the extra star), who had to break the news to me shortly after our first conversation, that regrettably although a 'priority' the items wouldn't be here for another Month.

Glad to say I finally received a bright and breezy e-mail on the 26th April ...(this year)...triumphantly declaring;

... ""Great news! your order is now in stock""...

So 6 months later I'm now able to use the 77mm VND filter I got with the main order for Christmas '18...yay...

Having decided to try film photography…,"Having decided to try film photography again after decades of using digital, I thought it would be good to start with some B&W film on a back to back basis using a couple of my old camera bodies. So I came to the Wex website and ended up selecting two same-make films for the purpose, differrently named and, as expected therefore, with differently described characterics. These were ""Ilford Delta 400 Professional"" and ""Ilford Delta 400 Pro"". Of course those ""in the know"" will realise my mistake, since as I discovered on their arrival, apart from the fact of one being 24exp and the other 36exp they are otherwise the exact same film! So it defeated my initial object and leaves me with a potentially unwanted extra film. My unhappiness is that when I therefore rang Wex thinking the mistake to have been theirs, I found the assistant unsymapthetic and apparently not even accepting my point that their advert listing is misleading. Anyone would know that ""Pro"" means the same thing as ""Professional"" was the comment. True, but an ""1.6S"" or ""1600Sport"" on the back of a car can be denoting quite differnet models in its range!

"Old inaccurate website reviews, slow & inaccurate customer service, don't publish negative reviews","Wex took over Calumet Photographic who I've bought from for many years and had been excellent, so of course, I bought from Wex. I read the reviews of Interfit Strobies Speedlite Softbox 80x80cm, the only review for this product on their website, since Wex themselves gave no folded dimensions for the softbox, I went by the ""this comes in a quality bag same size as a dinner plate and opens up to its full size"". I ordered two as I needed a matched pair.  They split my order and sent me one.

It turned out the description in the review was totally wrong, it doesn't fold smaller than a right angle triangle, with the long side a bit over 80cm, I don't know what you eat your dinner off, but my plate certainly isn't that size. I queried this with their customer services, twice. Initially they assured me it would fold smaller, but the person assuring me had no first-hand knowledge of the product. The one I received certainly wouldn't fold like a pop tent without significant damage. I questioned again by email. They took so long to get back to me that in the meantime I contacted Interfit direct, they said it might be an old version that could fold that small, but the current version just folded to the triangle. 9 days after my email question to Wex, they responded to say their ""category manager"" had said it should come with a small dinner plate size bag, and if I wanted to return the one I had, they would replace it. 

When I responded to say I didn't think this was the case and had contacted Interfit direct and received conflicting information, they then said they ""stood corrected"" - why their customer services couldn't have made the exact same enquiry I made to Interfit I have no idea.

In the intervening 9 days, I had also written a review, photographing the bag I had been sent with a dinner plate for scale. They have not published this review and the inaccurate 3-year-old one is still on their site weeks after being notified it is erroneous.

They also have a stock system on their website which even if they only have one item in stock, allows you to add up to 99 of them to your basket, pay for them, and only then be told that they don't have stock and your order will either be split or delayed.  They decided to split my order and send out one 80x80cm softbox before reading my email suggesting I could opt for two 60x60cm versions as they did have a pair those in stock, so by sending out a part order they took that option away. 

So, I mourn the loss of Calumet, my second experience of Wex, and perhaps my last. Resting on the laurels of their predecessors IMHO.",,2018-10-07T22:33:14Z,2,Stephen de Saulles,,32
Appalling part exchange experience,"I arranged a part exchange valuation at Calumet Manchester. Booked the appointment in advanced and advised of the new equipment I wanted. 

The valuation itself went very well and I was happy with the price they offered.  Unfortunately they ordered the wrong equipment for me so I couldn't take anything away that day although it was delivered the following day, a Saturday.

The part ex value was more then the cost of what I was purchasing so there was a credit on my account.  I was told it would be no problem to transfer this so I could use it via Wex and I duly sent the details - order number etc to Wex.  I phoned Wex three days later to check on progress and was told it was in progress (Josh).  I emailed two days later to be sent a blunt email (Josh) - ""Our credit control team say you've spent the credit"".  I certainly had not.  Phoned Wex and their operator (Simon) agreed I hand't spent it but he would have to speak to someone in London to get it sorted and would phone me back later that day.  He didn't.

I phoned the following day and had to recount the story again and was told it would be looked into. (Leo)

The day after that I got a very apologetic email stating that the credit would be applied to my account and to use it I would have to phone when ready to place an order - I couldn't do it online.  Two days later I emailed to ask if the account had been applied and was told it was STILL in progress.  

So ten days after my original purchase there is still no sign of my £316 on my account.

It's very disappointing to have to write this review but the above are facts and clearly Wex have not integrated the Calumet business in a way that is satisfactory to customers.",,2018-07-02T14:05:13Z,2,Ian,,14

Poor quality replacements.,"Poor quality replacements.

I have used Wex a couple of times in the past and they have been fine. However, on my last purchase of a drone, the battery on the item was not working properly so I asked for a replacement and quickly bought replacement batteries to be able to use the item. They explained it wasn't possible to replace the faulty batter and they would have to replace the entire drone, which I had spent hours calibrating and setting up. After several emails to their sales department, they agreed to send me a replacement battery which took over a week. When it finally arrived, the box looked like it had been kicked around their warehouse, the manual was missing and, of course, the battery didn't work. I should also point out the serial number on the box didn't match that of the battery, therefore it wasn't a new item from stock. It's been over 3 weeks since I purchased the drone and I still don't have a replacement battery. I'm still waiting for their sales department to get back to me with a solution. If I hadn't bought replacement batteries (from a different vendor) I would still be unable to fly the drone!

Part Exchange: The £10 Scam,"I wish that I'd read the warnings here before sending my lens to WEX. Like many others, I sent them a mint condition item. Like many others, I received a call saying that there was a slight problem with the item and that in light of this they felt a £10 reduction in their quote was fair.

However, the lens that I sent to WEX was brand new. There was no ""dust on the front and rear optics"". There were certainly no ""light scratches on the barrel"". It came from Amazon as part of a bundle and went straight to WEX.

When Laura called me her voice was a rote monotone as she cited the problems with my item. It's clearly something she does so frequently that it's become boring.

Those £10s quickly add up.

After 15 years of doing business with WEX I've decided to call it quits. I've cancelled my pending orders and I've decided to find a new, more honest company to deal with.

*** Update ***

Thanks for making contact, WEX.

Your Part Exchange team acted dishonestly. My trust in you as a company is gone. As such, I'm uncertain how further dialogue between us would change the situation.

Poor after sales.,"This is my worst experience to date with Wex. My Benro tripod had issue with the plastic clasp which needed fixed, I filled out the form and sent back as requested. Wex received the tripod back promptly and was told 3-4 weeks which I thought seemed long but accepted as it was a policy. 3 or so weeks in they said they hadn’t had an update which yet but will contact Benro for an update, 4 weeks passed I contacted Wex back again and they then asked questions about other issues and asked if you like these fixed which I didn’t as it was going to cost and were minor. In this time no work had been done. 7 weeks passed I contacted them again and it was the same typical response they will find out, I then called back a few days later to be told they are waiting for a part from China now. Baring in mind this is a plastic clasp. it wasn’t till the 8 week when I complained I spoken to a manager and said if it’s not back by the 9th week we will look at other options. it wasnt until the 11th week of it being sent back to Wex and stil telling me it’s getting fixed I told Wex I want something else done. They offered me the money back for my tripod which and an extra £20 on Top to purchase a tripod with them. Which wasn’t near enough to the Same spec tripod i had and the price I paid. After a discussion with a manager they agree for £50 on top but I Still wouldn’t be able to get the same Spec tripod without putting money in myself. So I had to add £40 on top.

Multiple customer service issues,"I have used Wex previously and been impressed with their prices and satisfied with their customer service. However, after my last experience I will be very unlikely to purchase from them again.
I ordered a product from them on 18th March, primarily because at the time the price was cheaper than anywhere else I'd seen the product.
The courier (Parcelforce) texted me on 19th March to say they would deliver the next day. I knew that no one would be at home so I texted back with the option to have the product delivered to a local post office. They still tried to deliver on the 20th, but on the 21st they did in fact deliver it to the local post office. I checked the opening hours of the post office on the Parcelforce website and went to pick the package up that evening. Unfortunately, despite the website saying it would be open, the post office was closed.
When I returned home, I discovered that Parcelforce had not left an attempted delivery slip, despite a text message stating that they had - this scuppered my plan of leaving the slip and some my ID with one of my parents so they could collect it on my behalf.
On 22nd March I called Wex customer service to advise them that I did not know when the post office was actually open, nor could I ask someone else to collect the package, and therefore that I wasn't able to collect it. I explained that I understood that the issue was something that was outside of their direct control. The member of staff I spoke to said he had spoken to Parcelforce, and that they would collect the package and try to deliver it to my house.
I heard nothing until 31st March when I had a rare day off, so I decided to call at the post office again on the off chance it was open and the package hadn't been collected. The post office was closed, despite Parcelforce's website showing it as open.
I called Wex again, and was informed that the Parcelforce head office was closed, but that the member of staff I spoke to would look into the matter and was promised a call back on 3rd April.
I hadn't received a call by 4:30pm on the 3rd, so I called Wex yet again. Again I explained my predicament, whereupon I was told that Parcelfporce hadn't collected the package yet and it would be another 3-5 working days before they would be able to collect it and attempt delivery. I asked that Wex despatch a replacement product directly to me and arrange to collect the one at the post office at their convenience in order to speed things up. After the phone call, I received an email confirming the replacement order, but showing that the product was now out of stock, completely negating the reason for sending a replacement product out.
At this point, I completely lost patience with Wex, sourced the product through Amazon and replied to an email from Wex's customer service department, requesting that they cancel the order and refund my payment.
By 10:00am on 4th April, I hadn't received any response to my email, so I had to call Wex again in order to obtain a refund.
So, I'm now at the end of my tether with Wex. When I spoke to their customer service manager, I was offered a £30 goodwill voucher, but my confidence in Wex is now completely shot, so I am unlikely to use it. This review would have been one star but for the fact that Wex's representatives were never rude.",,2018-04-04T10:17:43Z,2,James,,1

New Wex Rental is chaotic & disorganised,"The new Wex Rental currently feels unsuitable for professional use. I turned up to pickup a piece of kit for use the next day on a job. The kit had come back broken and they had no replacement or alternative solution ready to go. They had only called me about an hour before pickup was ready (and missed me). Eventually, after about 30mins in the shop, an alternative lens was arranged and couriered to me.

8 days after returning the kit I rang up to chase the deposit, which hadn't been processed. This was done on the phone but in the process they tried to charge me 2 days' rental instead of 1, which I had to correct them on. This felt similar to when I first booked the kit, based on the quote given on the website. When I rang up to pay and confirm, it turned out the cost of delivery was effectively double what the website had very clearly said (the website's details on shipping are incorrect currently).

Whilst the staff are very friendly, at the moment this feels like a very chaotic operation - whereas I can only remember Calumet Rental being a smooth experience (Dec 2017).",,2017-12-21T10:15:56Z,2,jacobdsj ,,2
Good service spoiled by using a poor courier.,"The service I received from Wex was generally very good. The item was at a competitive price, it was well packaged and promptly dispatched. However the whole buying experience was spoiled by their insistence on using Parcelforce. I knew from previous experience that this company is probably the worst of a pretty poor lot so I asked Wex if they could use an alternative courier for me, but they said not. Therefore I took the risk, and  what happened was predictably awful. It would seem from other reviews that I am not the only Wex customer to have had this problem. I would happily pay a few pounds more to have my goods delivered by a courier that paid some attention to delivery requests, gave more options for collection, and kept the recipient advised of the expected time of their delivery.

Repeated poor delivery performance.,"Repeated poor delivery performance.

From my experience and other feedback this appears to be a recurring issue with Wex. Over the past twelve months I have spent over £5000 with them, but once again their insistence on using ParcelForce has caused inconvenience with the next day delivery not being honoured. The result was another day tied to the house awaiting delivery. Each time they are very polite and refund the cost, but as I explained to their representative Kate, that really isn't the point. The refund is obligatory as the service was not provided. The issue is the failure to provide the service and subsequent inconvenience. There are many other delivery companies who offer a more consistent performance within a very accurate time window. 

I asked if there was a process where I could send them some feedback directly and was promised a callback by a manager. Unfortunately I did not receive any form of contact from them other than the refund for the failed delivery service.

The staff are always very polite, however to repeatedly experience the same issue when spending this amount of money is very poor, hence the rating.",,2017-09-27T20:01:44Z,2,Paul Simmers,,5

It has now been delivered and I hope to see it when I return from my holiday:(  I was gutted not to have my camera to enjoy.",,2017-04-14T08:12:21Z,2,Moorky,,2
Very disappointing purchase experience this time around.,"I ordered 3 spare Phantom 4 batteries and the postage got messed up. There was no 'sorry there was a problem' message from the Wex team, not even after I chased up to ask why the parcel was returned to sender.

Not good, guys!

"Good at taking your money, no so good when it goes wrong","Good at taking your money, not so good when things go wrong, awful attitude on phone when trying sort it out, ok when your spending your money. Had to return items then wait for your refund, yet you have to pay them right away, so takes well over a week once they get the item back, yet takes more than a week get your money back.",,2017-02-07T19:14:28Z,2,Kevin,,10
Part Exchange ripoff,"I sent my Canon 70d to Wex Photographic for estimate of value for part exchange. I was told that on testing they found a fault which I agreed to have an estemate for repair from them. They returned some 10 days later informing me that the repair would cost £250.00 with no explanation as to what would be done or any prices and cost of items. making my offer now £140 for what would be a mint condition camera. I declined and had my camera returned to me. Today 19th Jan 2017 I took my faulty Canon 70d for repair at a Canon authorised repair centre at Colchester and they informed me that the repair will cost £87.00 inc parts, Labour and vat. I feel cheated by Wex Photographic who sold me my camera in the first place and do not feel that they deserve the ratings given to them.I have lost the opportunity to grab a bargain and the £80.00 Canon cashback.",,2017-01-19T17:43:57Z,2,Trevor Polley,,14
All very good except for delivery,"Good website and straightforward ordering but all let down by their courier Parcel Force. They have had three alleged attempts at delivery to a manned Business Centre reception and on two occasions they've left a card to say there was no one at reception, on the first attempt no card was left at all. Also, their website tracking system is useless, it only gets updated at approximately 5pm so if the driver hasn't left a card or you're tracking it remotely, you only find out at 5pm that a delivery was allegedly attempted at 11am. So four days later I'm still waiting for my goods and considering not accepting the parcel if it eventually turns up. Parcel Force are the only delivery company out of many that come to the business centre that fail every time to deliver goods smoothly. Whilst I like dealing with WEX, I'm seriously considering avoiding them because of this.",,2017-01-18T20:13:02Z,2,Phil Melia,,8
"Great Prices, But 3 Orders - 3 Problems :(","I order from Wex because their prices are competitive, and their range is amongst the best out there. And I will be ordering from them again, I'm sure. I just wish the website 'in stock' labels could be trusted - and I really wish they didn't use Parcelforce for deliveries.

Placed 3 orders in the same week. Everything showed as 'in stock' on the website at checkout. Just wasn't true. First two orders each had 1 item 'out of stock'. A couple of quick phone calls sorted out one of the orders. (Telephone support was great. Hardly any wait to speak to someone, and they seem to have access to accurate stock levels).

Third order was in stock, but Parcelforce made no attempt to deliver it on time. It's frustrating to pay for a service that isn't provided, to say the least. It's a waste of time and money and good will.",,2016-12-05T20:52:24Z,2,Stuart,,1
Slow process. Poor trade in price. Company fails to ring back and explain,"I sent a camera in for part exchange in August 2016. I was told it needed a clean of the sensor and that the kit zoom lens with it was not saleable due to a fault which was not worth repairing. However the lens needed to remain with camera for the cleaning. Months have gone by and I now have received £40 for the OMD M5 body in the wex account. I have not received the ""unsaleable"" kit lens back (where is it?) and the eventual trade in price was very low. I bought through Wex  a new camera and lens in late August. I have spoken by phone to Wex and they promised to check and ring me back but no further calls have been received. At the very least i think i received a very poor deal for the trade in and I cannot get the £40 refunded onto my card against the recent purchases. Seems the only way I can get the money back is to buy something else from Wex which I do not want to do.",,2016-11-19T14:06:48Z,2,Rob Chapman,,7
Poor service,"I ordered a camera and lens yesterday 17th November and paid for next day delivery, and waited in all day, and when it got to 3pm I contacted WEX via chat to ask if the camera and lens were still being delivered and I was told ""yes I have checked with Parcel Force and they are out for delivery"". When I got home I checked on my computer via the tracking number and the good havent even been delivered to the local Parcel Force depot. So I contacted WEX on Chat again, and explained what the situation was and all I got was ""sorry they may be with you tomorrow or Monday"". Why Monday when i have paid for next day delivery? oh because thats the next ""working day"". So I asked that they cancel the order as I am not prepared to take another day off. Oh we cant do that we have to attempt delivery and when we get the goods back we will do a refund. I understand this may well be a Parcel Force issue, but never the less some empathy or a refund of the delivery would have been a nice gesture! overall a poor experience.

I contacted Parcel Force last night and they said Wex could have upgraded the delivery to Saturday delivery, however as it stands its sat in York and will be delivered on Monday 5 days after I ordered and paid for next day delivery! There will ne know one in on Monday as I can't take another day off work. If your delivery service is like this now god help consumers when xmas comes. I know mistakes happen but your response to resolving the issue has been pitiful.",,2016-11-18T16:19:17Z,2,Ian Brown,,36

Poor Company for business,"I have purchased many brand new items from WEX in the past and they have been brilliant, However I had hear fabulous reviews about their second hand purchasing equipment. 

I took the chance to purchase a Sigma 70-200mm and they sold me a broken lens which does not focus outside of 70mm on top of this before placing my order I was advised different information from different advisors which resulted in me paying more for my overall order which I was not impressed about.

POOR COMMS,"I ordered this camera 28th Jan.16. Was informed I would receive it by March 24th. It finally arrived 17th June! Wex took my camera as trade-in which I was happy to do on the assumption I would take possession of my D5 in March. I had to buy a D750 to keep me working through this period. A very expensive interim solution!
My complaint is that even though the delay may well have been the fault of Nikon, communication from Wex was abysmal and after spending a heap load of cash with them I now think twice. I used to think their customer service was spot on.",,2016-06-27T11:25:41Z,2,Rowanlaw,,10
Next day delivery- didn't happen,"I ordered a lens and paid for next day delivery. I waited in all day, but the delivery didn't happen. It was very inconvenient for me to waste a whole day. They clearly knew that they had not sent the product, but couldn't be bothered to send an email to advise of the delay. The lens arrived the following day and they have emailed to say they are refunding the delivery charge, but this doesn't make up for my wasted day. If there are issues with a delivery surely one simple email is not too much to expect ! Next time I will go elsewhere.",,2016-06-13T17:46:39Z,2,Philip ,,3
Poor value for money.,"I purchased a used Phantom 3 4K on the Saturday for 549 pounds. That was just under 150 pounds cheaper than the new drone.  I went on line on the following Monday to find that, before it had even arrived, the new drone had been reduced to 549 pounds. The same price I paid for the second hand drone. 

To compound the issues I had paid for a micro SD card at 34 pounds. So I'm total that comes to 583 pounds. 

With the new drone you get this card for free, which means I paid 34 pounds more for my second hand drone and card than what it would cost from new.  

I made contact with wex and they offered me a 50 pounds refund. Accepting this would mean I then purchase the second hand drone and card with a saving of 16 pounds when compared with the new drone.  

Obviously I was not happy with this. They then offered to exchange the second hand drone for a new one.  

To be honest with working hours I find it hard enough to get the drone I have purchased delivered so I didn't want to mess about getting the second hand drone sent off/collected and then get the new one delivered.  I accepted the 50 pounds and put it down to experience. 

Over the past 4 years I have spent over 6500 pound on products from wex. This negative experience has prompted me to never shop with you again. 

I did asked to be removed from your mailing list, something that has not been done. 

I know this may sound petty but if I had not had a nose on line on the Monday I may never have noticed that i was being ripped off. I wonder how many other people this has happen to. 

I'm sure someone must have know the price of the new drone was being reduced on the Monday. 

So I have a drone that I know has been used by someone else and saved 16 pounds. Whenever you buy a second item you take a risk. For taking that risk I was saving 150 pounds. But no I didn't.

Sent faulty item and seem to be making a drama out of returning it,"Just over two weeks ago I ordered a used battery grip from Wex and paid for next day delivery. As promised it turned up next day. Unfortunately, there was a large crack in the casing (the packaging was perfect so I don't think it was damaged in the post - but who knows). These things happen, so I emailed then saying what had happened and asking for a replacement or a refund. 

It then turned into a weird email ping-pong. 
Them... ""could you send us a picture of the damage?""
Me... ""sure""
Them... ""we've passed this to our technical department for consideration""
Me... (days pass) ""is anything happening?""
Them... ""oh, well if you want to return it please fill in a returns form""
Me... ""ok, here it is""
I eventually send it back and now I'm waiting again. After several more days I received an email to say they had got it and to allow up to 7 days for a refund (it's now 5). 

It's not that they have done anything nasty as such. But I thought it was clear cut and I thought I was clear and they've been quite ineffective and they've had my money for over two weeks for something I don't have. Never mind my time sorting it out.

I was out, a card left through the letter box for a missed delivery this meant two trips to a post offive (42 miles) and 2 hrs of my time wasted simply because my specific delivery instructions to leave in a safe place wasnt complied with. Today I ordered 2 Nikon D5 cameras from another competitor, Wex lost the order because they failed to do what was asked for a very valid reason.

Arrogance,"This company seems very casual with large sums of my money. If you order two items, and one is not available, You may find that there is a  charge for them both held against your account, along with a separate charge for the item that is available if you want them to send it to you. Like me, you may find this takes you considerably overdrawn and spend several hours on the phone to the bank making sure they don't charge you overdraft charges. Meanwhile, Wex photographic insist to you that this couldn't possibly happen, And not listen to you at all. After you have spoken to the bank you'll find you have to get this company to send them a fax with your details to cancel the money on account. Only then do you find that they have sent a fax to someone, but the bank claims never to have received it, So you are left not knowing who they have faxed with all of your banking details. I thoroughly recommend you to use a company with more integrity than this one.
I will amend this as they have finally held their hand up and admitted their poor management this week. It has taken four hours of phone calls to sort out. I wailltherefore given 2 stars instead of one",,2016-04-22T13:35:44Z,2,Tom Humphries,,3
"Bought new, received 2nd hand, sorted out though.","Had good experiences with Wex previously until I bought a new lens.  The one which arrived had a badly scratched 2nd hand lens cap and the front element of the lens was covered in dust!
Tried to return the lens, wex arranged a courier to pick up but due to wex getting the postcode wrong (the same postcode as the previous delivery address) it was not picked up at the time specified.  After repeated phone calls, they did eventually have the old lens picked up and a new one despatched, although they wanted me to pay again for the new one and then refund the old one, or they had to wait until they had receipt from the courier that the old one had been collected which luckily is what happened.  To be fair to Wex, they did correct the problem within 24 hours, BUT I am still bemused as to why it happened in the first place and I'm not completely confident that if I buy from them again, I will be getting a new item when I have paid for a new item. Such a shame.",,2016-04-11T11:37:17Z,2,Cameron Shaw,,8
poor packing,"Bought a Canon 5DS, it was shipped after 1 week, even if I selected next day delivery, It was bought with finance, Barclays approved it next day, WEX sent the camera one week later, the camera was in the original box and the original box was in a plain carton box without any protection bubble wrap or anything, the focusing is off on every lens (front focusing). I paid £2700, I expect at least proper packaging, a 5ds is not a bag o potatoes. Wex was my favorite camera retailer, not anymore.",,2016-04-06T12:32:17Z,2,Constantin Malanciuc,,7
Second Hand lenses had problems not mentioned in the description.,"Hi, 

I bought one camera and couple of lenses from them. Both of the lenses had problems not mentioned in the description. some of them really annoying and visible. 
I complained and sent videos to show the problem in both lenses, they tried to help me but it was not very adequate. 

For one lens I ask them for a refund to replace the broken part, they agree: £25 for replacement part. 
For the second lens the agreed on pick up the lens and inspection it and fix it by canon, turnaround about 2 weeks, as I can not be without the lens for that long and they are not going to pay for hire another one I ask them to cancel it. It rather stay with a not so great lens and not well described that nothing. 

Overall not very happy with the service or experience...

Astrophotography? Shop elsewhere,"I rang for advice before ordering an Ioptron Skyguider at £500. 

Question: ""Do I need anything else?""
Answer: ""No""

NOT TRUE, and when I rang for help I was told to ring back at 10am to speak to Simon. I did, he was off sick. Therefore no one could help. 

2 things: 
1) the Skyguider did not come with a transformer - only a 12v car cigarette lighter socket. 
2) the Skyguider only comes with a single counterweight that is not sufficient to balance a Nikon DSLR, even with a small lens (combined weight incl ball head I tried was 2.3kg). Therefore you need to buy more, not found on Wex's website. 
The combined solution to both issues is buy the battery pack counterweight from Altairastro.com for an additional £160

On this occasion I wish I'd gone there in the first place.",,2016-03-24T18:31:58Z,2,David Huggett,,3
What a mess!,"Ordered several items including 2 L series Canon lenses and a camera bag. I paid for next day delivery too. 
Received confirmation for some items but not the lenses. When I phoned WEX they seemed confused, they could see the items and the payment but their system allocated the funds to the wrong place - not my problem I said but they sent me an email saying it would be dealt with in the next 24 hours. Eventually after several calls they agreed to send the lenses out.
I still haven't received the camera bag (their website said awaiting stock - 5 days) it has now been way too long. I called (again) and they replied with an email saying they had no ETA from their supplier. So this means I could be waiting days, weeks or even months! How can they take my money and have absolutely no idea how long the item may take to arrive? Very poor service from what I thought was a respectable company. I have since ordered several £K of other equipment (jib, sliders, lights, monitors and batteries along with other items) I need for my project - from proav.co.uk - not from WEX, and had a great service.",,2016-01-11T21:03:59Z,2,Tony Evans,,7
Not the best buying experience or product.,"I ordered 2 Elinchrom BRX Flash Heads due for delivery next day. As it happens I had to leave the house for a few minutes and obviously at that point ParcelForce tried to delivery them. I only found out several hours later when I checked the tracking site to find they had apparently attempted delivery several hours earlier - there was no card through the door, so no reschedule delivery or collect from depot options. (Note to WEX - use DPD they are much more flexible). 
The next working day I did receive the flash heads. When unpacked from their boxes they appeared to be very dusty as if they had been unpacked on a warehouse shelf for some months. Both lights came with sync cords (does anyone still use sync cords?) but no power leads so I was left to search the house late in the evening before a shoot the next morning for suitable power cords I could use with these lights. 
The heads themselves do not compare well with my existing 8 year old Elinchrom BXRi heads. The new heads feel like cheap plastic. The plastic bulb covers are very cheap and much worse then the old ones. The locking mechanisms don't feel like they will last long.",,2015-11-05T18:26:51Z,2,Adam Jefferson,,10
LATE DELIVERY,"I ordered a lens from WEX on October 28 and requested delivery for the morning of October 29, i.e. next morning delivery. My despatch email confirmed this. 

Order not delivered by mid afternoon. Looking at the Parcel Force Tracking page, my parcel was shown as being at the National Hub at 08:04 this morning. So much for next morning delivery.

Called WEX, they contacted Parcel Force and I am now being told that my parcel will be delivered on October 30. 

Second time this has happened to me.",,2015-10-29T16:32:50Z,2,Stephen Bloomfield,,1
The ordering and delivery process is rather slow and complicated,"The whole ordering process was rather slow from start to finish, and although the staff at Wex tried their best to remove any obstacles and progress the order there are some things that Wex could have done to make the process quicker and simpler. For example there are no staff available at the weekend to complete the credit application so that had to wait until the following Monday. Then the credit application is sent out by post to be signed when  it could have been sent by email, and the signed copy scanned and returned by email. This would have shortened the process by 2 whole days.
The delay caused by Parcel Force also could have been avoided. Apparently they ""forgot to put it on the van""  so it was not delivered on the date promised, despite the fact that their tracking system said it had been loaded onto the van. There was no explanation or apology from Parcel Force. They might as well not have a tracking system if it is going to be inaccurate.",,2015-10-16T18:28:51Z,2,Ian Jack,,6
"Broken Promises, Arrogant Customer Service","I needed 2 Nikon D800 bodies for a shoot complete with lens kits. Spoke to Wex explaining that the total order would be around £5-7K and could they do a deal on Bodies with Lens. ""Yes"", I was told. 
I explained that I'd call back in 48 hours when I'd recced the location but was told I should purchase the bodies immediately as they were in used stock and that moves fast. They said they'd put a note on the account agreeing the deal when I came back with my lens order, so I gave them my card details and completed the purchase of the bodies. 
(Although shipped on an overnight service, the bodies took 72 hours to arrive)

I called back with my lens order as agreed and spoke to a different advisor. He was very arrogant and no way I'd put an employee like that in a customer facing job. Told me from the start they don't do deals, and refused to connect me to the lovely advisor I'd spoken to days earlier. Was very cocky and said they'd never ever do a deal on a 'small purchase of only a few thousand pounds'.(!)

Spoke to the Customer Service manager who empathised and said he'd see what he could do. After a couple of hours the lovely advisor (not allowed to use names on TrustPilot!) phoned me back and said his hands were tied, they couldn't do a package deal as promised and offered just £30 off a £5,000 order ""as a token gesture"".

As I'd already spent £2,000 on camera bodies I felt this was a really dirty trick and despite years of business with WEX, I won't shop there ever again.

After canceling my order I requested an email copy confirming my cancelation, it was promptly set.
The email stated that the funds will normally be returned with 3 working days, it's been nearly 2 weeks and I still have yet to receive my money!! I have spoken with my bank to double check that they are not holding my money back, they are not. My bank has offered to help me out should wex continue not to not pay back my money they owe me.

Seems best to deal with them via shop rather than at a distance,"I've found them frustrating to deal with online, as they do not respond to emails - at least not promptly, and on several occasions, not at all. Phoning them is an equally frustrating experience - they seem to have a very large number of people answering the phones, so it's difficult to get hold of the person you dealt with before. I have also had hassle over the pricing of a memory card which I bought along with a (new) camera & lenses. The gear had to be returned to them, as the camera was DOA. I've now been charged almost twice the original price for the memory card (which I had opened), because they say the original price was a promo. Their overall prices may SEEM good, but I'd never deal with them again at a distance. I'm told they're good to deal with if you happen to be in/near Norwich and can get to the shop in person.",,2015-01-23T14:15:11Z,2,Fiona Stark,,26
Get a new courier,"Bought a Canon speedlight that I needed urgently for a commission, to replace one that got smashed the day before. Paid extra for Saturday delivery which I was told would be delivered by 12-00 midday, nothing arrived, so waited in the rest of the day as I needed this for Mon am shoot. 
So having wasted all day waiting in for a non arriving flashgun I am screwed for my  Monday am shoot, thanks WEX and Parcelforce for your appalling service.
I now have to beg a friend to lend me their gear, for my shoot.
 If your current excuse for a courier service can't perform, I suggest you find a company that can as your current offering is crap.

Okay i don't do Facebook, so this appears to be the only way to answer you, so here goes,

Lee, thanks for the refund of the carriage, i'm sorry but i feel really strongly about this, i had a contract with WEX and you by using Parcelforce let me down very badly, not only did i loose a complete Saturday waiting for your non arriving parcel, but i then had to scrounge gear for my 6-00am shoot today. 
MY professional day rate is £650-00 per day ,so who refunds me for the day lost on Saturday? I really suggest that you look @ you couriers as i will never use WEX again as long as you use them. 
I currently have a £10,000 budget to update my Canon gear, guess where i won't be spending it??

I expected better,"In dire need of a new Lastolite vinyl train, an email from Wex Photographic offering me free postage and next day delivery encouraged me to make the purchase. Everything appeared well, and the FedEx tracking facility showed that the item was indeed en-route to me. Sadly the following morning the FedEx tracking facility showed a 'mis-sort' at the local depot. Despite a number of attempts the local depot were not able to deliver the item the next day as promised. In fact, I had to wait from Thursday, over the weekend, till Monday for a promised delivery. Monday arrived and I again checked the FedEx tracking facility. Mid-morning the facility revealed an 'address query' which mean that their satnav couldn't find me. Despite repeated promises, I eventually discovered that I would have to wait for another 24 hours. My customers couldn't wait that long, and this had already meant me having to have someone at home all day Friday and Monday. A waste of time. I subsequently cancelled the order. FedEx offered no apologies and were actually quite rude. My emails have been courteously answered by Wex Photographic, but my phone call two days ago requesting a full refund has still to be actioned. At the time of writing I still await a full refund, which is preventing me from buying a replacement item locally. All I have received since my phone call two days ago is an automated email telling me that I may have to wait 7 days. I cannot run a business on a platform of orders/refunds being dealt with like this. Thank you.",,2013-10-03T13:39:07Z,2,Doc Roberts,,1
"Unfortunately, Wex got it wrong this time","I've used Wex in the past and experienced great service. Unfortunately, this time they got it all wrong.

I ordered the lens before 18:30hrs on the Weds and paid for next day delivery as I needed the lens the following evening.  I arranged to be in all day to receive the parcel but when it got to about 16:00 with no sign of a delivery, I gave Wex a call to see if they could update me as to where the courier was.  The CSA I spoke to informed me that the order would be with me tomorrow; they're sorry but an error had been made on their part and it wasn't noticed until this morning.  Although it had been noticed that morning, they didn't inform me that I wouldn't be getting my order that day even though I'd paid for next day delivery.  If I had known earlier, I could have arranged purchase somewhere else for that evening (I know it was last minute on my part; but that's presumably why they offer a next day delivery service - for folk like me).  So I said that I wanted to cancel the order and get a refund; no problem, they acknowledged it was their error and a refund would be authorised straight away.  After I had hung up the phone, a got a call back from them saying that the order had already been packed and dispatched and delivery will be made tomorrow, the next day.  As I had already cancelled the order, I was advised not to accept the delivery and assured - no worries - that a refund would be made immediately (may take a couple of days depending on my card supplier).  I was disappointed that this had happened and wrote Wex an email explaining the situation and this unfortunate experience.  Fast forward over a week later, still no refund so I called Wex to chase.  Apparently they were waiting for the lens to be returned to them (customer refuses order) before it gets returned to the depot, and processed for refund.  I told them of my situation; the CSA was sympathetic and said that he'd get the refund paid in next couple of days. I asked for it immediately given the circumstances and also to call me back to confirm when it is authorised.  He did indeed call me back and let me know that I'd get my refund, and I did.

To date, I have not received an reply to my email to Wex.  I acknowledge that there were no signs of malicious intent here; the CSAs that I spoke to were professional and friendly, it was just a series of unfortunate events but it does means that I will look at ordering from other companies in the future.  Wex has normally been my go-to. Shame because I was planning on putting in a big order.

UPDATE:  20 September 2013.
*Unfortunately I can't seem to reply to the response I got from Wex, so I have updated this review*

Thanks for your prompt reply.  

I appreciate the time you've taken to read my review and pass on my feedback to your Customer Service Manager. I look forward to hearing from them soon.",,2013-09-18T16:43:55Z,2,HY,,1
"Good product, poor delivery commitment","The Product was as I wanted and In stock. I had searched the internet for the same product and decided to use WEX again on the basis of good past experience.

I also, chose WEX because the item was in stock and promised for next day delivery. It just so happened that I had a voucher which provided free delivery. I went this route because I needed the product in my hands to test and get used to before I did a job with it.
So, I paid early in the Monday morning. 
Later in the afternoon I get confirmation email saying the goods had been despatched and to expect delivery on the Tuesday which would give me time to test it on the Tuesday evening / Wednesday, 10 minutes later I get another email saying there was a problem and I would get the goods the day after next  being Wednesday (that's now, not a next day delivery service and voucher was also worthless). I could have of purchased the product cheaper with the same delivery with another supplier.
I reply to the last email asking what's going on, no response so I reply again the following day. This time I get a informative response confirming that I would see the product the following day. I asked if 'Next Day' meant anything up to 7pm (this would be useless as I'd already be out the door on my way to the job in London town). I was told they would try to contact the courier and see if they could arrange an earlier delivery (I did not get the feeling that this was a certainty).
On the Morning of the job I finally get the product but did not have enough time in the day to test and get used to the product before the job. I received a further email from WEX informing me the product had been delivered. Thanks.
So, at the job I had to learn on the job (far from what I had planned and wanted) making me stressed and uncomfortable.

I had no further email apologising for the later than planned delivery. The voucher code was a waste too.

Since I was planning on purchasing a Nikon D800 from WEX in the very near future I'm now looking at purchasing that piece of kit elsewhere. Up until now I have felt very comfortable using WEX but this has cast a shadow.

You asked my opinion and here it is.

Let down this time,Ordered a new SD card by 9am Thursday morning and paid for next working day delivery. Despatched by parcel force and arrived Monday in an envelope that could have been sent in the post,,2013-07-11T17:14:42Z,2,Alan Meek,"Aberdeen, GB",19
Things have changed.,I have been a customer here for many years and would until today have agreed with the glowing feedback left by others. Yesterday I had occasion to contact customer services again about an order. This time my order had not arrived on time. I was promised a follow up phone call with detail for my missing order. It did not happen. Based on recent experiences I know they won't care when I say - WEX you've lost another customer.,,2013-05-10T22:35:52Z,2,Cecil Greer,,11
Would never go back,"Very disappointed to turn up to make a choice between Canon 650D and the Nikon 5200 having done lots of research prior to arriving. The first assistant lacked enthusiasm and knowledge and took us to a PC where he did a 'comparison' between the models. We said we'd already done all that, we wanted to see how they worked/felt etc and make a live comparison.

We were told that we could look at and hold the Nikon, but as they hadn't been sent a display model they wouldn't allow us to turn it on or take pics with it. So we couldn't make any evaluation or comparison. Staff were unhelpful and inflexible ...they couldn't do anything about it, they said, because if they turned it on they would 'have to discount it'. We suggested it made better business sense to sell it at a discount or have one for future customers to try before they buy, but they couldn't see the sense in this. The manager who was just two feet away, was too busy tapping on her computer to help us or the staff member.  It was a maddeningly bizarre and very frustrating experience.

So we left and spent £1850 at London Camera Exchange instead ...coming away from there with a range of lenses and accessories in addition. The LCE was a totally different experience... staff were knowledgeable, entusiastic and approachable, they let us try each camera, supplied a memory card to take shots with, even let us outside to take wideangle and distance shots. 5 stars to LCE, nil points to the very poor service at Wex",,2013-01-02T02:02:05Z,2,Corrie Rouch,,1
Price Discrepancy,"Don't take any notice of their advertised prices in the photographic press!  I checked them out for a Sigma 150mm macro advertised in several current mags. @ £439.99 but when I 'phoned them the price had shot up £119 to £558.  Bearing in mind my first question to them was ""do you have this lens in stock?"" the answer was - yes.  When I then asked them to honour the advertised price for an item in stock they just made excuses about advertised prices could be at least 3 weeks, and more usually 6 weeks out of date and referred me to the small print.  Understandable for a monthly mag but for the weekly AP I find this time delay an unacceptable answer especially considering  the advances in publishing technology. This was far from an isolated incident as other prices were hopelessly out of date!  Needless to say I sourced this lens elsewhere for £452 delivered and will not be using or recommending WE.
I noticed that they were not allowerd to exhibit at Focus On Imaging and  ran a full page ad claiming this was because their prices were too keen for the competition - dream on!",,2009-03-21T12:26:08Z,2,skip,,1
VERY poor service,"A used Sony SLR was advertised on the WarehouseExpress website.  When I telephoned to ask about it I was told it had been returned as faulty but when tested by Sony was found to be fine.  I asked a lot of questions before deciding to place my order - one being 'did the camera come with all the accessories?'.

The camera arrived with no accessories whatsoever; no cables or mains charger.  With no means of charging the battery it was useless.  I telephone WarehouseExpress who apologised and arranged to get the camera collected.  It was - but I have been unable to get a refund from them.  After nearly a month of telephone calls, broken promises and explanations I am still waiting.  A very bad experience all round; apart from the young lady in the sales office who did try her best.
