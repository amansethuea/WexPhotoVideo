"Great ordering, delivery & refund experience","Ordering and delivery were extremely easy and the item I ordered arrived very well packaged. 
Unfortunately I had to return the item, a flashgun that had been converted to UV. While this was mentioned in the small print as someone new to photography I had not realised. Really if an item is modified from factory conditions I think the product title should make this clear with bold text advising customers. 

I then realised Wex don‚Äôt offer free returns and don‚Äôt have local stores like CeX where free returns are very quick, easy and convenient. Though their refund process once they had received the item was the quickest I‚Äôve ever experienced. All in all it cost me ¬£14 to return an item that had the description been clearer I wouldn‚Äôt have ordered. ",2024-04-08T00:00:00Z,2024-04-20T10:26:07Z,4,Me myself and I,,1

Equally the paperwork with the single item should have included an explanation of the shortage and when the outstanding items would be delivered. I had to call to ask when I could expect delivery of the outstanding items. Again this is something Wex should communicate immediately rather than leaving it to the customer to log on for half the story and then have to phone to get the delivery date.

Initial problem was sorted out by Wex Manager,"Very disappointed with my recent experience with WEX used equipment.  I placed an order for a used Canon EF 70-200 f/4 IS USM lens which was graded condition 9+, I received the non-IS variant which I had to return. 

I spoke with WEX online and they reassured me the 9+ condition lens was available and would be sent out out me.  

Then I received emails stating that a 9- lens would be sent out, I queried this and was told it was just part of their automated process and the correct lens would be sent out.  

The next day I was told again that a 9- lens would be sent out as the 9+ lens was no longer available (no explanation was given as to where the original lens had gone).  

Very disappointed with the initial failure to fulfil the order as made, then the subsequent mixed-messages were very disappointing.  

At no point was anyone from WEX willing to explain what had gone wrong and where the original 9+ lens that I had ordered had gone :-(


UPDATE Tuesday 13th March - After speaking with Peter from Wex on the telephone last week, he was able to find me a suitable replacement lens which I am now very happy with.  Thanks to Peter for his excellent customer service skills.",2024-03-08T00:00:00Z,2024-03-11T01:13:18Z,4,James,,1

WFT-R10B customer return purchase,"I bought a Canon Wireless File Transmitter WFT-R10B listed as customer return. At the RRP this is an expensive item, but the 40% reduction tempted me. A call to the Norwich store to find out more about the condition and warrantee proved unhelpful other than stating that the warrantee was twelve-months.
I decided to gamble and purchased online. The item was received within two days, packed in a strong outer carton. The WFT-R10B was in the original OEM box complete with internal packing and documentation.
Close inspection did not reveal any indication of use, it was as new from the factory, with connector protection caps in place. I registered the item on the Canon site.
The Advanced User guide was downloaded from the Canon site. However, IT knowledge is helpful in setting up the WFT-R10B for file transfer using FTP on a Windows 11 server. LAN connection to the EOS Utility was easier. File transfer from an EOS R5 over a 1GHz LAN network is rapid, a wireless connection is slower.
So far, I am pleased with the performance of the WFT-R10B, which has proved a shrewd buy. I am now better informed, but it would be useful for WEX to explain the terms MO, open-box, customer return, in terms of warrantee and registration. My invoice stated the item as ""used"", which has a different connotation to the other terms.
I have bought several items from WEX, both new and used, and have been satisfied with the service.",2024-01-31T00:00:00Z,2024-02-06T12:57:47Z,4,JC,,15

Rude telephone service marks down overall good experience,"The goods were delivered on time and as expected, well packaged and as described. Generally, that part of the service was great and I'd give it five stars, but...

I made the order late on a Saturday night, in two separate orders. In the first, I paid for next-day delivery. In the second, I didn't, because I didn't want to pay twice for something that could be sent in one box!

So, first thing Sunday (about 10am local time), I called the shop and asked that the orders be bundled. The gentleman who answered the phone was extremely rude and wouldn't even take my order number, just told me that what I was asking was impossible, and they'll ship separately. I asked him to cancel the order so that I can re-order. He again refused and told me I'd have to ship it back to them.

Except... that when the orders arrived on my doorstep the packages had in fact been combined and shipped as one in overnight delivery.

Delivery address roulette,"Ordered a camera from WeX and they managed to give the courier the wrong details as to where to send it - having contacted support, this has gone unanswered and the package remains destined to the wrong address.

WeX seems to have become more careless of late, my previous order of a lens had to be returned because it had not been properly checked and had a sticking aperture, leading to overexposed shots (something that didn't occur in transit), so when not being sent to the wrong place, it's not being checked before it is sent sufficiently.

Whether I get my parcel now will be potluck it seems - quite appalling when this is expensive electronic equipment.

Update: True to their word, WEX contacted me and sorted the address issue out, and offered a partial refund. 

The camera did thankfully then arrive at the right address, and it is in a good condition and as described in the listing on the site. So, all sorted in the end and I have revised the rating based on the CS making things right.",2023-11-13T00:00:00Z,2023-11-13T13:36:17Z,4,Marty Greenwell,"Lincs, GB",26

Disappointed,"***UPDATE***

My complaint was handled swiftly.  Whilst I didn't get the amount I initially expected, they did increase the offer to something more respectable.

***

I really don't like leaving 1 star reviews, but I feel like I've been let down after what was a really promising start.

I sent in my camera and graded it as per their website, there was a minor bit of paint loss to the front dial but barely noticeable.  On top of that, it included a genuine battery, along with additional extras such as a lens cap, genuine hand grip and wrist strap.

I called up and they said there were a couple of dents, however, I took a set of comprehensive photographs of the camera before packaging it up - along with photos of the packaging itself, and there were certainly no dents.  I'm more than happy to provide these photos to you.

Given how carefully packaged it was, I can only come to the conclusion that the 'dents' are fictional and they're just trying to bump the price down.  I appreciate they say it's a 'grey import', however, that should have 0 effect on the price as that only really matters in terms of manufacturer warranty, which isn't a factor here?

It feels like a bit of a con and now I don't know what to do - I don't really want the hassle of having the camera returned, but the amount they offered is quite derisory.  I did call to see if they could reassess and offer a little more, but seems they're pretty inflexible.

A real shame, I had high hopes.",2023-10-31T00:00:00Z,2023-10-31T17:29:52Z,4,Jtalep,,55

"Good overall, some improvement in communication.","I had to call for a second hand purchase and also to pay a deposit, with the rest on finance, which was handy for me.

Unfortunately I never received am email with a tracking number for the camera which did arrive on Monday. I still haven't found the tracking email... Not in inbox or spam...
Item was well packed and to be fair camera came with all the parts which weren't mentioned on the description so that made up for it.

"Overall great, with a minor annoyance on this occasion","I'm rating my latest purchase from Wex. I love this company and have been using them for years. I almost always buy used items from them. Their pricing is reasonable and have a 12 month warranty.

My most recent purchase was for a used video camera which is ideal for my current work. It was advertised as well-used. I don't mind. They are always clean and fully functional. The price was about 1/5th of the current new price. Yes you read correctly. So I jumped at the chance.

When I received it, it was pretty well as described and seems to be working as expected. However I noticed that on the underside, the main tripod connector was missing. There is an alternative connector which is slightly larger. But the main one that attaches to everything, is missing. This is a bit of a big deal. It's a heavy camera and I'd feel more comfortable using both connectors for safety. The only other issue was already mentioned and I was ok with it (scratching on viewfinder).

Wex tend to be poor at photographing their used items. I would expect about 12 pictures for a large complex video camera. And definitely one showing any declared damage. The issue I found wasn't declared or photographed.

So I have written to Wex to ask what can be done. I realise the options are limited. I don't really want to return it, but think this damage should have been declared, so there's no nasty surprises.

Overall though, and as often happens with Wex, there were a couple of extras I wasn't expecting, so that's a plus. Thanks Wex - you're my go-to store for everything phtogrqapic, and have the nicest staff!",2023-08-31T00:00:00Z,2023-09-07T11:03:31Z,4,Paul G,,13

Would Liked To Have Awarded Five Stars,"I was looking for a good quality used lens. The information on Wex website stated that it was in mint condition and came with original box, both rear & front caps and original manual. It was as described and in pristine condition with all the accessories, the only downside was the manual was in every language but English. Neither Wex nor Nikon could supply an English version. I knew that I could download a copy from Nikon but I like to have originals - just a personal thing, hence the four star review. In every other respect Wex cannot be faulted and offer first class customer service along with sound technical advice.",2023-08-20T00:00:00Z,2023-08-27T11:59:40Z,4,Geoff Allen,,15

Could so easily be 5stars if price more competitive. ( I know that some firms were charging ¬£100 less than wex / canon / one or two others, many charging approx ¬£50 less ) thing that swung it for me to wex, is the prompt service, and real assistance if things do go wrong / part faulty. But it took a while to convince myself at upto ¬£100 more than some!

I only take 1 star away because they used Parcelforce for the delivery, which is perhaps the worst delivery company - I paid for Sunday delivery and waited at the door all morning, only to get a text saying that they'd attempted delivery but there was nobody in.

My only critique is that the included INOV8 flight case is sub par. I don't intend to use it for the Go 3. The Go 3 sits in the case with the lens pressed up against one half of the case, with the screen pressed up against the other half. With the Go 3 being slightly thicker than the inside of the case this means that any pressure applied to the case is going to be translated directly onto arguably the only two parts of the camera you would least want it to. I purchased a Lowepro CS20. If Wex want to significantly increase the value of their premium Go 3 bundle, I recommend including this small case in the bundle instead.",2023-07-11T00:00:00Z,2023-07-23T13:14:10Z,4,RM,,2

My only issue was with their use of Parcel Force as they did not call me from my front gated entrance to deliver on the arranged date and had to attempt another day.  All other couriers (like DPD etc.) seem not to have this issue.  Otherwise I would give 5 star,2023-06-22T23:00:00Z,2023-07-12T16:47:28Z,4,Ian Greaves,,20

The gent who answered was very helpful and polite and answered the question speedily so I decided to place an order for a new monitor. All went smoothly and it was delivered the next day in good order. On opening the box I found that the specifications shown on the internet stated that the unit had hdmi, dvi-d and playport input sockets but in fact it had hdmi, playport and vga sockets, but no dvi-d socket!

Wex are helpful and fast to despatch,"Wex are helpful and fast to despatch.

Luckily the driver did leave it with a neighbour so I was able to use it on day 2 of my job.

"New camera failed after 10 weeks' use, but...","Bought a new, top of the range OM camera from WEX which failed after 10 weeks' use. Phoned customer service and I was offered a repair only, which meant I was left without a camera. After two weeks I'd had no word, so called again and only after insisting firmly that I wanted my call to be upscaled was it dealt with and a replacement offered which came two days later. That was great, but the camera should never have been sent in for a repair in the first place - not after a mere 10 weeks of use. In the end Wex really stepped up to the mark; I'm snapping away happily again with my new OM1 and WEX has honoured their offer of a goodwill gesture.",2023-06-27T00:00:00Z,2023-07-04T16:46:17Z,4,customer,,4

Great used lens purchase and customer service!,"Overall, I have had a great experience with Wex, both in terms of the items and service received. I have bought a new camera, new audio equipment, a used camera, and a used lens (my most recent order on the 17th June). All of the items were well-packaged and of good quality/ as expected. 

I have to say that, with a couple of previous orders, I had a few minor issues. However, these were dealt with very promptly, professionally, and satisfactorily. I had a great response from Martin from the Customer Service Team. He explained why the delivery of my items did not arrive when I expected them. He generously offered some credit on my account to put towards my next Wex order because of the inconvenience experienced. I felt that Martin listened to my feedback about the communication of expected delivery times on the website.

I've not given 5* because I think the item descriptions for products could be better/ clearer. The used lens I ordered was described as grade 9+ and in mint condition. But there is a fairly deep ding and several light scratches on the top of the lens near the front. Also, my previous order (for a used camera) came with the official battery charger with a European plug rather than a UK one. It's not the end of the world as I have several plug adapters. It would have been useful to know this though before ordering that particular camera.",2023-06-16T23:00:00Z,2023-06-30T23:13:40Z,4,Nick S,,2

Worth considering as a source of used gear.,"I bought a used camera, which was delivered quickly and in roughly the condition described. 
However, I think Wex could improve their service to potential buyers of used cameras by using higher resolution photos and providing top, bottom and side views, not just front and back, in their listings. Descriptions and ratings alone are too open to interpretation by the customer. For example, one phrase used in Wex descriptions is ‚Äú shining to edges‚Äù, which means very little to most people, I would suggest. On the other hand, being able to see in a photograph the condition of, for example, the base of the camera, gives a clear indication of wear and tear, and of the care with which the camera is likely to have been treated generally.",2023-06-17T23:00:00Z,2023-06-29T23:35:04Z,4,Ian P,,32

"Purchasing was Great, P/x was a bit of a faff.","In terms of trust - there are no issues at all with this company. My experience was okay. I had about ¬£1k worth of gear in my basket and wanted to trade in some older gear I had. The valuation and exchange process was relatively quick and easy. I had a bit of a faff with being told that the 2nd of 2 boxes of goods for trade in was not received but after I found the tracking and showed it was signed for, it was soon found. Due to the delay with the 'lost' items, one of the products that I was looking to buy (the main item in my basket) sold out with none in stock and no-one able to advise the next available delivery of stock which was super frustrating as the whole point in ordering from Wex was to trade in old equipment and use the trade in value against my own purchases...so I had to purchase the main item elsewhere. They also couldn't find my account, to add the store credit to but were soon able to once I screenshot my account when logged into their page.
All the goods were then purchased and delivered quickly so I think for purchases only - great site, great price, great delivery, decent communications....but with the Part Exchange, I think I just got unlucky with the various things described above which is why I'm going 4* instead of 5*.

I have to say that the customer service from Wex is excellent thou. I been contacted by them few time on that occasion. I got some small refund for inconvenience. As my drone did't arrived on time. Because of that  I have added a star to my previous review.
i will buy more stuff from them for sure but will wait till they will change the courier company.


Orginal:
I just bought the DJI drone together with the fly more kit.
Over 1k order and there was an option for named day delivery that I have used. It was supposed to be delivered the next day and on that occasion I took off from my work to be at home when the courier knocked on my door.
But....where the problem starts. Wex Photo uses the worst courier company on the market -Parcelforce! and like you can guess they did not deliver my parcel on that day when I was waiting for them. So... they probably will do that on another day but no one is going to be home so in that case the parcel will go back to the depot which actually is far far away from my home.

The problem arises 
in that they won‚Äôt give you a delivery time like every other courier (1-2hour window) and if I‚Äôm not in Parcel Force take it back to depot and you can only collect it between 8-10am, so basically you need to be there when delivered.",2023-04-12T00:00:00Z,2023-04-16T16:43:07Z,4,Mr Kirk,,36

One thing I would add tho is that it would be good for the customer to be able to see the contents of their order once ordered, some items come with varied additional contents, like neck strap, batteries, leads, it would be good to be able to see this after the order is made so that the missing bits (if any) can be purchased separately at the same time.",2023-04-09T23:00:00Z,2023-04-16T10:12:54Z,4,simon,,14

Skywatcher 130P Telescope,"I'm very pleased with this Telescope, as a beginner it's simple to use, allowing me to concentrate on learning the night sky.  An expert Astronomer friend of mine carried out Collimation & made a small adjustment to the main Mirror as the locking screws had become loose in transit. It's very portable & well made for the price point.  Parcelforce messaged me with a lunchtime 1 hour time slot at 8am, but didn't deliver until nearly 6pm. 4 hours late.",2023-03-30T23:00:00Z,2023-04-11T15:50:47Z,4,Mr Tottle,,13

As detailed here by other customers, their text messages and web tracking data are meaningless. If they miss their delivery date they simply advance the website data (which has stated yesterday and today that the parcel was 'out for delivery') by one day - and no text message to offer new delivery times or explanation. Given the value of the items and sensible necessity to sign for delivery this means sitting at home all day. One understands that sometimes next day deliveries can be difficult but the failure to inform customers when things go wrong is unacceptable. Find a new courier Wex - or perhaps demand a refund, which is probably the only way to gain their attention...",2023-03-17T00:00:00Z,2023-03-17T12:19:34Z,4,Brian Mulligan,,10

The first had a paper feed problem the replacement had the same problem but a change of make and the third Is working just fine. The team worked well to sort out my problems. I cannot fault them likewise I cannot hold them responsible for two faulty printers it‚Äôs just a bad batch. The way they resolved it was great and timely.

It would have been better had this information been provided in the first place.

Having said that, the rest of my dealings were excellent.  The Z5 and lens were out-of-stock but I wasn't asked to pay anything until they came into stock (by which time the listed price had gone up substantially), I was kept updated by email and when my order was available customer services processed my payment (at the original price) & arranged delivery for a day of my choosing.",2023-01-05T00:00:00Z,2023-01-31T14:26:05Z,4,Ian Marshall,,5

The person I spoke to at Wex said the he thought the the delivery address had been culled from PayPal.... except PayPal has the full address... so somewhere there seems to be a systems issue.

That‚Äôs the only criticism I have for an otherwise faultless service.

Although it said next day delivery I was not really expecting this as I was aware of things out of their control causing a delay. But it sat in the local post office depot for a week before it was delivered.
I had sent in an update to Wex and suddenly it appeared but not sure if this was down to them or Parcelforce deciding it needed delivering.
Reply to response:  Again I was not expecting one straight away and that is a reasonable turnaround time.

Ordered online an Epson projector for‚Ä¶,"Ordered online an Epson projector for delivery to a friend's address but when I checked this hadn't happened - this was probably a combination of my unfamiliarity with your system and a possible system quirk. I phoned in and your staff quickly put things right and promised dispatch for overnight delivery which they did.
However Parcelforce failed to send it out for delivery next day (a Thursday) and also on Friday. Of course when they finally tried to deliver on the Saturday nobody was in but they did finally deliver on the Monday. This item wasn't particularly urgent but what is important is certainty of when it is going to be delivered - no communications were received from Parcelforce although they did leave a card after the delivery attempt.
My previous experience with Parcelfarce(not involving Wex) is that they are one of the least satisfactory delivery companies and I would suggest you might look elsewhere for a new delivery partner.

The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars was that the Olympus ""camera and lens kit"" outer box was ripped, and inside that I found the Olympus camera box was scratched.

Very easy to deal with,"Very easy to deal with, my only concern was that after I sent my equipment I got the final quote which was less than the original quote which I accepted but there was no explanation as to why it was reduced, other than that the new camera I chose was in stock and delivered free the following day so overall a simple process.",,2022-06-08T14:32:01Z,4,David Ward,,5

Great but delivery times are misleading,"I have had a few things from Wex new and second hand and they are tryst worthy and the kit is as described.
The only reason this is 4 stars is the web site says next day delivery on things and then it is sent Parcelforce that doesn't operate on the weekends etc.
If the website said that it would not be an issue, bit we are all so used to Amazon saying it will come tomorrow and it does, that I don't really feel you can not meet that standard and get a full 5 stars.",,2022-06-05T14:55:43Z,4,Customer Pete G,,7

Ridiculous packaging size.,The product and service was excellent but I was amazed to find that a single camera battery was packaged in a box 29cm x 21cm x 19cm.

"BenQ SW240 Pro 24"" Monitor","The BenQ monitor was received within a couple of days of ordering. It was well packaged and safely delivered.
Looking at the instructions for the connections to make to my Dell laptop there was a lack of clarity about the cables supplied. The Quick Start installation manual does not include any text but shows a choice of up to 6 cables - only 3 were included in the box and none of them were able to connect to my laptop which has USB-C ports.
I ordered a Dell multiple port adapter to connect HDMI/DP and another cable connector to plug into the monitor. 
With this set up I finally managed to get the monitor to work - but at an extra cost of ¬£48.00! 
I think that BenQ should supply a connector cable which is compatible to the latest USB ports that have been in use on laptops for at least 18 months.

Not as good an experience as expected.,"My item was not in stock so it took a few weeks to arrive, which was fine. This is my first telescope and I spent a fair amount of money and had expected everything to work. So, I was very disappointed when I tried to align the sighting scope only to find that it didn't work. I found the whole process of constructing the telescope quite nerve racking as the 
guide was not great and assumed prior knowledge. I contacted the helpline and they sent out a new scope within a few days. Well done support team. Overall, a little annoyed with the purchase process as what should have been an exciting experience was disappointing and a little bit fraught with problems. Scope should have been checked before being sent. However, I am quite happy with my purchase. Maybe Celestron need to look at their quality control because, from what I could gather, this happens quite a bit.",,2022-01-31T11:41:04Z,4,Charles Byrne,,13

Purchased camera,"I recently bought camera for which I had to wait for a while as it wasn't in stock which I knew at the time of purchase. The camera came with great deal from Canon and would give cash back after purchase which is great. This was my first purchase with such offer therefore I had no idea how this works. Sadly WEX didn't sent an automated email to tell me what steps to take to receive the cash back. I had to emailed them and received a short email back to say what needs to be done. Wouldn't be a better customer service if all the info was sent automatically to customers post purchase? I know you are not responsible for the cash back however the only reason why I bought this camera was because of the great offer therefore you're getting my sale. This isn't a complaint but a constructive feedback. Also please work a little on less dry replays as your emails always sound like customer is bothering you.

"Good product, good price, but could have been a little easier","I‚Äôd been looking at a new camera bag for a few months in various places. We‚Äôd had it for a good price come Black Friday. The site could have been a little easier to navigate (when I put the brand into the search box, it didn‚Äôt come up, and I can‚Äôt remember how I found it eventually). The product itself is faultless.

Delivery was via Parcelforce, who attempted a delivery (no one home), I tried to rearrange for a day when someone be in as per the instructions on the delivery card. They attempted again the next day as per their delivery policy, so I rearranged again for the same date I‚Äôd already tried - the main problem with Parcelforce is that I didn‚Äôt get any acknowledgment of the new delivery date so it was a bit of a waiting game.

Wex from customers view,"Have used store in Manchester Leeds and event stand at the photography show.

Leeds visited twice once when they opened. Staff seemed busy had to chase after them. Lots of Nikon lens not in stock no monitors on display.
Manchester store last time visited staff more interested in football on tv.
More stock but short on Nikon. Plus they did have toilet that was able to used.
Have purchased from both stores and don‚Äôt feel welcome 
Have ordered online products came well packaged and within reasonable time frames.
I really want Wex  to be my go to company for photo equipment. At the moment there one of three.

Customer service is excellent. Back-ordering system could be smoother.,"I've placed three orders now with Wex and have always been impressed with the quality of customer service they provide over the phone. Great phone service should be a given in retail, but many e-tailers go out of their way to make it difficult to call them. Not so with Wex, their number is easy to find and I always get through after a couple of rings.

My only quibble was with the back-ordering system they have in place. After placing a back order, I waited several weeks without contact and had to chase. The response I received was vague. I understand many businesses are struggling with supply chain issues right now, but that only makes it more important to keep the customer fully apprised at every step along the way.

When my order did come back into stock, the onus was on me to call up and reauthorise payment within 7 days. I could've easily missed that email and lost my order entirely, after having waited for more than a month. A more pro-active approach from Wex would've made the experience more pleasureable.",,2021-10-18T09:48:08Z,4,Ian Pegg,,1

A4 light table review,"I ordered an A4 light table to act as a backlit stage for a boom-mounted bench dissecting microscope, which by its nature can't have an underlit stage as found on a stand-mounted microscope. I expect that's not a typical use! The order arrived promptly and although the outside packaging looked a bit battered, everything was adequately protected within and it was easily installed, works fine and is robust enough for the intended use. For this purpose, I would have liked a bit more light intensity on the highest setting, but it does the job, and adjustments can always be made on captured digital images. The millimetre rules on long and short edges are a bonus I hadn't expected.",,2021-10-17T07:14:34Z,4,Martin Rand,,3

The purchase and delivery was excellent‚Ä¶,"The purchase and delivery was excellent but the packaging was poor. It said original packaging which turned out to be a kit lens box with the camera only literally rattling around inside. The outer box was filled with air bags but they didn't surround the kit box so all in all it was poorly packed. 
Although rated 9 there are deposits on the sensor which it says in the description was checked and clear. The other issue is sticking buttons (AE lock). I did ask about repair but have been offered a refund assuming because the sticky buttons would be quite an expensive strip and repair.
On the plus side I am really, really happy with the camera CANON EOS7D and the general condition is excellent so i am torn as to taking the chance on the sticking button getting better with use and cleaning the sensor or taking the refund. Summing up, it could have been better but i am very happy with the camera (niggles aside) and would certainly use them again.",,2021-10-08T08:47:37Z,4,simon ,,10

Have removed one star simply to provide constructive feedback to improve an already superb company. This pertains to the Wex website, which is unable to process its own gift certificates. This necessitates a call to Wex - with the attendant inconveniences, time spent hold etc - but most importantly, introduces a significant security risk, because you have to pass your credit card details, including Security code, to someone on the phone.

Customer service makes the difference,"I ordered a small, second-hand, camera accessory via the Wex website.  It arrived promptly.  Unfortunately, it was not as described: it was a similar item, with a very similar part number, but which did not meet my needs.  Wex customer services immediately agreed that the problem was at their end and arranged for the correct item to be sent.  They didn't ask for evidence of the mistake, they just took my word.  And, as the first item was worth barely more than the cost of arrange its return, they allowed me to keep it as a small gesture of good will.

Anyone can claim to provide competitively priced items via a website.  Providing knowledgable customer service staff who are empowered to make decisions is a different matter - and is the reason I have retuned to Wex again and again over the years.

I recently part- exchanged a lens to WEX and before the deal was done I specified it was to be a cash payment to me.  When the inspection result was received it specified a credit to my account.  In the circumstances a credit is no use to me because I no longer need to buy any photography equipment.  (My earlier review describes how the wrong lens was sent to me by WEX, forcing me to purchase another one from MPB.) 

I was expecting a battle to obtain cash, as I would have experienced with many other vendors.  I called WEX to challenge the credit offer and without quibble they immediately changed it to cash and confirmed it by email.

So well done WEX for quick action and excellent customer service after a false start.",,2021-09-16T09:27:54Z,4,MikeD,,6

"Wrong item supplied, not ideally resolved.","I have been dealing with WEX for years and have always been impressed by their customer service. I recently purchased a USED Canon EF 70-200mm f4 L IS USM Lens from them but the lens which arrived was the cheaper, non IS version. I emailed them to point out the error.

The outcome was not ideal but it was promptly handled.  WEX was unable to supply a correct version of the lens purchased so I had to settle for a refund.  I wanted a lens, not money.  They did also offer a ¬£20 credit to my account as an apology.

Now I will have to find one elsewhere and I will be disadvantaged because only WEX provides a 12 month warranty on used equipment.",,2021-09-15T07:55:28Z,4,MikeD,,6
Item ordered and delivered as promised,"Item ordered and delivered as promised. As usual, the boxed lens was contained in a much larger box with bubble wrap. Normally the bubble wrap would be wrapped and secured around the lens box, but on this occasion it was just loose pieces of bubble wrap thrown in, and when opened the lens box was up against an inside edge of the box, so not exactly ideal.",,2021-09-14T12:16:27Z,4,J Wilson ,"Maidenhead, GB",25
Professional Service at Competitive Prices,"I have been a Wex customer for many years and have found them to offer competitive prices and great service. I have recently purchased from other sellers, only due to the fact that of late Wex don't have the products I am looking for in stock, or I have to wait too long whist on pre-order. That is the only shortcoming I can think of. So, my first choice is Wex, if the products are not in stock or on pre-order I may purchase elsewhere.",,2021-09-13T17:05:46Z,4,Omar Shamma,,54

It is difficult to only give 4 stars...,"But I must be honest here. If I were only reviewing the Milton Keynes store, they would get 5 big fat golden stars, no question, but I am reviewing the chain, not one individual store, and the truth is, there are some issues, ones that can no longer be blamed on Covid etc. These issues are largely down to the way items are moved between stores, particularly used equipment, so be aware that if you are buying something used to collect in store, or having things shipped to your local store for pick up, you are most likely going to be hit with delays and other issues. Some work needs to be done there to improve speed and efficiency. 

Having said that, they are exceptionally competitive in terms of both their prices in store and online, as well as their quotes for any used equipment you want to trade in. The quality of any used equipment you buy is clearly defined, so you know exactly what you are getting and there are no surprises. 

Customer service from the Milton Keynes branch was exceptional enough to win my consumer loyalty, they bent over backwards to get me exactly what I wanted, then ruthlessly hunted down my items when the aforementioned delays occurred. They kept me apprised of the situation at all times and took measures to make it right on their own accord. I value good customer care  highly, and was not disappointed.",,2021-09-08T22:05:25Z,4,Mrs Nielsen,,8

Only downside was delivery by Parcel Force. I had to go and collect the item in the end despite paying for next-day delivery.

However, this is not the point, having spent nearly ¬£2,000 on the camera I felt it was not good enough.

Wex ace at new stuff but no so good on used,"I have been a customer of Wex for over 10 years! Excellent company, great customer support and team knowledge. The key thing has been great stock range, fast delivery and good after sales, as over many thousands spent a few things are dead on arrival, fail, need returning, etc, for which they have been excellent. More recently I have bought and sold a lot of second hand kit with Wex. Unfortunately this is not so good and could only get a 2 star at best. The range is low, speed of checking kit very slow and I have had VERY confused customer service on more than one occasion, especially over trade-ins. MPB their main rival is really superb on used, far far faster and really efficient and clear customer service. So Wex, thanks for being great, I will buy new from you as ever, but PLEASE fix your used side and customer service/processes on used side.",,2021-05-28T09:00:24Z,4,David Furmage,,12

I received my camera in very quick time, however the courier handed
me a box that was completely crushed and said nothing ??

A good experience,"My experience overall was quite good in terms of getting advice and making an exchange; which was also processed and shipped very quickly.  However response time in the first instance, when I was trying to make a decision and act quickly with limited stock, was a little long and I ended up making the initial  purchase before hearing back; and in fact it wasn't the right kit for me.  I was kindly provided with a free interface cable, which wasn't included in the kit.  The chat function on the website wasn't working, although I was able to connect with someone at Canon regarding specific product queries.  Finally, it would help if the store here in Edinburgh stocked more models (including used models) to try out; when I went there to talk to them there wasn't much to work with and if one is inexperienced as I am, looking at a picture and reading the specs doesn't necessarily tell me what I need to know about size, weight, ease of use, etc.",,2021-05-25T07:46:14Z,4,AH,,3
Issue with the packaging,"Two points really...

First; box was slightly damaged om arrival though doubtless that is most likely down to the Royal Mail and their generally slapdash handling...

Second; the box was inappropriate.  Two small batteries (for a Canon Powershot) packed into a box easily big enough for DSLR and padded out with a couple or 3 airbags is not smart - they could easily have been packed into a padded envelope and been just as safe and secure and probably a lot more environmentally friendly as well...",,2021-05-24T13:40:33Z,4,NHH,,3

Had seen it needed a microSD card, so I had added one to my order. It arrived promptly and I've been having fun playing with it. Only quibble I've got is the lack of a USB C charging plug that's essential for charging the camera battery. I couldn't find one for sale on the Wex site and ended up going to Amazon. It was actually quite difficult to get the correct plug to use as the specification on the Canon web site didn't seem to match the specifications on any online shops I looked at and I couldn't find the model recommended by Canon anywhere.

Olympus lens and camera body order / Used kit exchange.,"I was getting too much shoulder cramp etc., carrying my Canon gear which had served me well so I decided I wanted a 4/3 ""carry-around kit"" but to keep my canon 5dMklll / 100mm macro lens and newish 100-400mm telephoto (and teleconverters) ""wildlife lens"".  I wasn't convinced the 4/3 kit would replace the performance of these. So I cleaned up my ""collection"" of canon lenses (5) I had accumulated over the years, and my Canon 7D, and sent them off to Wex for valuation. After a bit of haggling I was offered an acceptable price (bit lower than hoped for!) which gave me 80% of my initial 4/3 kit. (Rate 4/5) On the advice of a fellow sufferer who had swapped his heavy Canon gear for Olympus kit, I ordered my ""starter kit"". An Olympus ""pro"" 12-100mm lens and the OM-D M3 Mk lll camera in early May. The lens was in stock. The black camera body not but I contacted ""chat"" and I was told a delivery was expected in a few days. If I ordered both together I would get one as soon as next ""black"" batch arrived. As I expected this in a few day, I ordered both. The lens arrived as expected (rate 5/5). I was still awaiting the ""black"" body 2 weeks later (but stocks of the silver had arrived). Despite 2 chat sessions I really was given no idea of the camera body delivery date (Rate 2/5). I contacted customer services by email and had a prompt reply saying black body hopefully late in May and I could have a silver now if I wanted one.  I marginally preferred the black body - but a bird in the hand - and the sun's out. It's technically the same! So I rang customer services (replied after a few rings) and requested a change to a silver body. This was agreed and rapid despatch promised. Next day I see its ""out for delivery"" with Parcel Force. Excellent (rate 5/5). All well that ends well. Olympus seem to be the issue here with stock not keeping up with demand - but they may well have good (pandemic) reasons for this.",,2021-05-17T10:17:04Z,4,Mel,,12

Good advice for a novice,"I am very happy with my camera and equipment from Wex. I am a novice to photography, so I was heavily reliant on the advice I received. The salesperson listened to my requirements and put a package together that met my requirements and budget. The only product that let me down was a pop up light tent for product photography. The salesman was unable to fold it back up for storage, and for some reason I bought it anyway thinking I would be able to do it at home.

Only niggle: I emailed after a couple of months waiting to ask if the printer was *ever* going to be in stock or whether I should buy another brand; their reply was simply ""The printer isn't in stock yet"" and rather missed the point of whether I should give up and cancel the order.

Tried tricking me into thinking I‚Äôve saved money,"EDIT After reading and responding to this review, Wex refunded some money and gave me a lot better deal which I‚Äôm happy with. I‚Äôm obviously a little put off about the original customer service, but this team member was bery helpful. 

Due to the softboxes in the kit I wanted to buy being out of stock and Wex said they had no confirmed date when they‚Äôd be back I had to buy everything seperatly from the kit including 2 softboxes of a different size from those in the kit. Of course this made it a lot more expensive to buy inidividually. On an email, a team member said to ring up and they could possibly try to do a similar deal. I did so, and placed my order. However they tried to make it seem like I have saved a discount of ¬£104 when really I wasn‚Äôt saving anything as I could have bought the 2 flash heads and stands in a kit, then the softboxes seperately. The team member just did the entire order individually then took off ¬£104 to make it the same price as if I had done it with the kit and then softboxes. 

So basically, I have paid more money and recieved less items than what would be in the out of stock kit as you also get a case with that. I just don‚Äôt like the fact they have tried to trick me into thinking I am saving money. And lastly, they really need to put fragile stickers on boxes, and ensure they aren‚Äôt damaged. One of the flash head boxes had been punctured which isn‚Äôt good on a piece of kit that is worth hundreds",,2021-04-26T22:49:06Z,4,Louise Machin,,1

-The battery should have been in it's pouch but it was rattling around loose. 
-And the camera had not been restored to factory defaults. I'm not surprised it had been returned because as it was set up there was no way to get an in-focus, properly exposed image! I felt the panic that I'd received faulty goods. However, easily fixed by simply restoring to defaults.

I've bought from Wex used and new‚Ä¶,"I've bought from Wex used and new lenses and cameras over the last 10 years.
Customer service and knowledge is 5 star ! Choice of gear and availability also 5 star ! 
The reason I'm deducting 1 star is Wex grading system for secondhand items. It doesn't use traditional exc , exc+ etc but numbers from 1-10 (it seems). Why I find this grading system misleading is that almost all their goods fall into 9, 9- and 9+ area. This would indicate almost mint / 10 to me but is far from it. I recently bought a used camera which was graded 9 and had obvious signs of wear and use. Wex does give a more detailed condition explanation for each individual item. Nevertheless the first thing potential buyers see is the grading number which I find misleading !
As long as buyers of second hand goods are aware of this there is absolutely no reason not to buy from Wex ! 
On top of that they accept returns readily within a set time scale.

Nikon camera/lens trade-in and upgrade,"I recently traded in my Nikon D80 body plus now unwanted Nikon lenses to obtain credit on the purchase of a second-hand Nikon D7200 body. The valuation of my kit on inspection was disappointing compared with the original estimate. However, an explanation was politely given when I queried it. The D7200 body was in excellent condition as advertised but was missing accessories provided with the camera when new i.e, USB cable and eye cup. Wex did not stock these items (disappointing).

What I do appreciate is how often I've been able to find secondhand or opened-box items at very good prices. I always check out the site to see if what I need is available used. Their new prices can be very good and I've always had good customer service when I've needed it.

Helpful Website - Internal procedures need a little improvement,"I bought a Canon camera recently and the website was clear to read and helpful to get around, although sometimes became a bit cluttered with information. Understandable given that some purchases can be very expensive and one wouldn't want to making that kind of mistake ! This is in total contrast to Canon's own website which I have found to be more than unhelpful on several occasions.
Where there was a fall off in helpfulness was when I was attempting to get information only about part exchanges and found myself actually making an application when I did not mean to. The person on the Chatline helped sort out the situation calmly and patiently.
The suggestion that the part exchange process was pain free also left a little to be desired in that it appeared that an original offer had been reduced based on incorrect information, but then that incorrect information had no bearing on the matter - confusing and time wasting !",,2021-02-02T11:15:54Z,4,Geoff H,,3

Great experience,With a slightly heavy heart I have  to take off one star. This is due to problems with delivery that was late due to the courier. Otherwise the experience with Wex was definitely 5 stars as ever. Easy to navigate on their website and to find the product I was looking for. Smooth and safe payment process and almost immediate dispatch. It is worth noting that the Wex staff was responsive and helpful with sorting out the bit of a cock up with the delivery (including  refund for the failed ‚Äúnext business day‚Äù delivery). The product arrived meticulously packaged in a pristine condition. I am recommending Wex to all my friends and colleagues as a reliable online store with photographic equipment.,,2021-02-01T09:26:03Z,4,Piotr Szczypa,,3

"Good Photo & Video Vendor (UK)for New , Used, Trade in Goods - Extremely Good Online /  Remote Vendor","04/01/2021 Experience
===================
I have used WEX Photo Video for many years and found there are very good on price, selection of items and the most important point I look for (and others) good customer service (especially on occasions when things go wrong).     Having trade in some old equipment which WEX Photo Video gave me a fair price (also they have very good used equipment on sale) I put in order for a new Nikon Z7.     Unfortunately due to stock issues (not WEX's fault - supplier issues from Nikon) I had to wait and wait until I had to unfortunately contact Wex to find out what was going on.      Due to Wex and other UK retailers not knowing exactly when Z7's will be sent from Nikon I received order for Z6 II + lens option instead - although I would have liked and paid for the Z7 II + lens option + Grip option; Wex stuck to the Guns of Z6 option.

I have marked down my score down to 3/5 due to this and for items out of stock like on pre-order from supplier, e.g., Nikon UK, etc or not fulfilling my final wish.

There should be update emails / messages along the waiting for item process to tell the customers on the progress of full filling their item.

Updated 14/10/2021 - In the past my engagement with Wex has been without issue and previously marked my experiences as 5/5, it was just this transaction that went a bit south and still at moment likely to purchase from Park cameras and local stores to me - London Camera Exchange.

12/07/2023 - Part Exchange
======================
Whilst slowly moving over to Mirrorless (Nikon Z & small Sony E system) I looked at trading in some of my older Nikon F mount lenses and 1 Z lens 28-75 F2.8 Z (non S) for cash to purchase (over time) some new Z lenses - like Tamron Z 70-300 & rest of cash received in trade in to use in future.

The process of Trade in by Wex is excellent, Online quote generator is easy and offer fair price, next:- drop in store but in my case Royal Mail picked up,    Wex received it, inspected each item and then give their findings.      In my case 3 of my modern lenses 70-300 AF-P, 24-85 & Z 28-75 passed QC and received good trade in price by WEX.

Unfortunately one of my older Nikon F DX lens 16-XX had damage / moist and fungus; (used it on DX older bodies in and outside ; may got some moisture in.    Hard for me to spot damage - in the elements; especially if you don't know what you looking for.     Wex explained the damage and offer choice of disposal or return back, - As this lens is not worth much now; selected option A and Wex took care of this.

The final trade in process - of paying the customer is easy - Wex gives you secure link, fill out your information (make sure the TRFX Info is correct) and you get paid via TRF 1-3 business working days.

13/07/2023 - Extremely Happy with WEX - buy new, trade in and buy second hand - from now on when I have the $$/¬£¬£ saved up will use either WEX or for me (just as good) local London Camera Exchange branch.

Both WEX and LCE are excellent - hope they can also keep relevant (tech) and branch out, e.g., unlocked Mobiles, tablets, etc.

Fast dispatch and reliable delivery as expected,"The goods arrived exactly as expected and according to the postage method that I paid for (next day service). The goods were expertly packed and overall it was a great buying experience.

The only reason for not giving five stars is the price, although I realise that the selling price for these egg crate grids is pretty much the same across all retailers. My issue is that we pay through the nose for these grids that cost a fraction of the price that we pay. Moreover, they are almost definitely manufactured in China or similar.

The grids perform quite well but they should be much, much, much cheaper to buy.",,2020-12-12T11:06:38Z,4,Dominic,,18

Good service. Need to sharpen up QA slightly.,"A good selection of photographic equipment generally with competitive prices. My only niggle was that the lens I ordered came in a damaged box (looked to have been dropped on a corner). While there are no obvious signs of damage to the lens itself, it does show a lack of care in the warehouse. There was plenty of surrounding padding and no sign of trauma to the outer box, the damage to the lens‚Äôs own box must have occurred prior to shipping. This suggests they need to take more care in their dispatch and/or warehousing dept. I always keep a lens‚Äôs box as it is useful in the event I trade the lens in. A damaged box can‚Äôt help with the value given to my exchange lens. May also have caused shock to internals - fingers crossed it hasn't affected the lens performance.

Update 3rd Nov. Wex have passed my comments to the relevant department and made a very reasonable offer of either a discount or replacement lens. You can't say fairer than that so I have increased my rating accordingly.",,2020-10-30T16:58:10Z,4,MR P WARNER,,10

Delay in payment for used items now resolved,"The exchange was was agreed but only after was it suggested the money was against credit on the account. I replied that this was not expected nor acceptable. They have possibly agreed to give me the money but now it is looking like a delay for unknown reasons. There has been no correspondence regarding any issues. At worst Wex have my money at best there was initial obfuscation about the process and now a delay. Poor communication in any case.

While Wex dispatched the item very swiftly and were very good a explaining and sorting me out with one of the missing items, I have ended up having to get some of the items from e-bay as they are no longer stocked or current items.

Very efficient and helpful  customer‚Ä¶,"Very efficient and helpful  customer service. However, I did feel that the company policy related to GDPR guidance has been interpreted in an unhelpful manner. When I rang about the fault with the new printer, I was informed by the agent that he could not discuss the matter as I was not the named person on invoice. The printer had been purchased by myself as a birthday present for my 17 year old daughter (whose name was on the invoice). I was then required to email the manager to confirm that I was in fact her legal guardian. As a result it took over a week for the problem to be resolved, which was only a matter of replacing a faulty ink cartridge !!",,2020-10-19T10:07:14Z,4,Jo Basford,,6

Camera advice,Having spent a number of hours reading reviews on cameras I decided to go to WEX to get their advice. On arrival we rang the bell as requested and after waiting 10 minutes rang again and again. Whilst I appreciate that the shop may have been full I would have expected the courtesy of someone letting us know that we would need to wait rather than be left stood there wondering if they had heard the bell. Once in I was given unbiased professional advice based on my requirements and I was able to handle the cameras to help make my decision. The purchase was straight forward and I did not feel there was any pressure for me to buy. I would recommend WEX for anyone needing advice/guidance for all photography requirements and would use them again. I would have given a 5 star rating if the arrival/greeting had been better managed.,,2020-10-13T10:36:52Z,4,Simon Clarkson,,23

I waited months for a new Canon camera‚Ä¶,"I waited months for a new Canon camera on pre-order, which was more a problem with Canon's supply chain that anything to do with Wex. During this time Wex were very good at keeping me updated, and didn't require any deposit to be paid to secure the product, which was a plus.
The product became available on a Friday in September and rather than contact me directly to offer a Saturday delivery, someone at Wex made a decision to send it for a non-weekend delivery. This was a shame as this was one of the last good weather weekends of of the summer, which somewhat tainted the buying experience.
Other than this relatively minor issue, it's been a good experience and I hope Wex can learn from this and communicate more with their customers on delivery options.",,2020-09-29T09:50:35Z,4,Geoff,,2

Ordering a little confusing,"I ordered the big stopper and little stopper and am delighted with both.

The only reason I dropped a star was when searching for the little stopper it came with options of just little stopper and little stopper with tin.  this led me to assume a tin wasn't included in the packaging.

I ordered a little stopper but ordered the tin seperately as to do this was cheaper than ordering both together.  A little confusing

All OK but 'next day delivery' does not work,"Everything went smoothly online. There were no human interactions required (this is neither good nor bad; just a comment).  I went to the online store via a third party website where a 'next day delivery' code was on offer. This code was not valid when I tried to use it. Even so, the high value item purchased itself offered 'next day delivery' but unfortunately, the item was not delivered the next day. This is not a problem for me since I did not require the item urgently. However, I think 'promises / offers' should not be made if it cannot be fulfilled.

Wandrd PRVKE 31Back Pack photography‚Ä¶,"Wandrd PRVKE 31Back Pack photography bundle-Very happy overall with this back pack. I used it on a 5 mile walk and also on a 25 mile bike ride-comfortable to carry 100 to 400 lens attached to full frame camera body plus another smaller camera and lens. Side and top access were very handy and worked well.The only slight issue with the side access,is that the velcro cover that wraps round the open side zip of the cube, is narrow(approx 9 cm wide) and does not wrap round the whole zip (approx 15 cm long) leaving the zip exposed at either side of the velcro. When trying to remove the camera and lens this was slightly fiddly as the camera body got caught on the uncovered zip. I think this would not be a problem with smaller camera bodies.",,2020-09-22T12:12:22Z,4,Joe,,1

The package came quickly and well-packaged.  However, they use Parcelforce to deliver.

I purchased a Sigma 70-200 f:2.8 sports‚Ä¶,"I purchased a Sigma 70-200 f:2.8 sports lens from WEX and the chap on the phone was very polite & helpful, My order was delivered quickly and well packaged, I'm delighted with my purchase and would (depending on price) purchase from WEX again.

The only issues I had with my order were with third parties not WEX themselves, ie. WEX offer a 'Buy Now Pay Later' finance option, but despite having a good credit rating, their finance company was reluctant to provide the service offered and rejected my application twice.

The second issue was with the courier, I got no notification that my order had been dispatched, was on route or was out for delivery, therefore I came home to find a parcel containing an ¬£1,100 Lens dumped on my doorstep.

Despite this I would purchase from WEX again, but rather than purchase online, I would preferably visit the store with my Credit/Debit card, or cash.",,2020-08-21T16:41:09Z,4,Alan Cullen,,4

Allow longer for WEX vouchers  to arrive during Covid,"I've ordered WEX vouchers before & been 100% satisfied; the only reason for awarding 4/5 on this occasion was the length of time the original hardcopy took to arrive - 11 days.

The rubber covering around the battery door was becoming detached. Secondly, I discovered that the D750 I received had not been returned to Nikon to have the widespread shutter fault repaired. I have returned the camera to Nikon myself to have this undertaken. I would have, at least, expected some warning of this in the camera description in the Wex advert.

Poor communication/service,"I have placed a ""special order"" item order. I have contacted twice for an update regarding a lead time. Twice I have been told a lead time could not be provided and I should wait for an email from purchasing. 
Communication from WEX is about as poor as any company I have ordered from. They have no automated process to provide a lead time on special order items. Having purchased special orders from other companies, I am accustomed to being emailed or called when the purchasing department has placed the order, to notify me of an anticipated delivery date. This has been the case with other companies despite the Covid19 pandemic.
I am awaiting an email today with the lead time for my order and if it remains awaited come the end of business today, I will be cancelling my order and taking my business and support elsewhere. 
Disappointing given that having had good experience with WEX in the past I have repeatedly recommended them to friends and family.

Edit: The response below is correct. I have received an email this afternoon stating that WEX received ""an update on this via email this morning and this is apparently in transit to us as we speak so we would expect delivery early next week"".

Martin has been helpful and communicative, better communication was all I wanted. I have raised my rating accordingly.",,2020-07-24T11:34:21Z,4,Chris Lindley,,13

3 Legged Thing Punks Travis Tripod,"I looked at several makes of tripod, searching for something of good quality at a reasonable budget and preferably not made by one of the huge 'global' brands, many of which have European sounding names but are actually Chinese. Nothing wrong with that, I just wanted to support a home-grown company.
The 3 Legged Thing Punks Travis seemed to fit the bill perfectly.
So I was a bit disappointed to find that, while the website made much of it being British designed and engineered, when it arrived it still had a 'Made in China' label on it (no mention of that on the website).
Having said that, the quality is excellent throughout and the tripod is perfect for my needs. There are also a number of accessories available should I wish to expand the system later on.
All in all, a great buy. But why oh why can't they be built here in the UK? If not for that, it would have been 5 stars.",,2020-06-02T12:47:28Z,4,Simon,,18

Generally OK on price. Just depends on what you're buying. Still worth shopping around since, understandably, it's not possible for WEX to stock or specialise in everything. 
Though WEX is one of the best specialist shops online I've found; for say sound equipment, I personally trust a shop like GAK. That said it all depends on what you're looking for.

In my experience WEX supply and keep up with most of the best gear on the market so if you're looking for reliable, practical and well designed gear, and an extensive choice at that, you can trust WEX. Well designed and functional gear is invaluable in my opinion and I know I'll find it here. Just do your research since most gear is not perfect.

"All good except for price discrepency, though Wex did resolve this after the event","Item wasn't in stock at the time of ordering. Placed order all the same and was notified promptly when Wex received a shipment. As over 1 month had elapsed I needed to reauthorise card payment. This was all well managed and satisfactory.

What wasn't so good was that since ordering the RRP had fallen ¬£15 from the price I paid. Maybe technically I had entered into a contract at the old price but morally I felt a little duped. I discovered this price drop after confirming my card details and progressing with the order. To their credit Wex did refund the ¬£15 when I pointed this out. Ideally, and to be fair, this should have been pointed out to me when confirming the order. Possibly there was a 'disconnect' and the system wasn't aware of the change in RRP...

WEX an efficient and trustworthy business.,"WEX are an efficient and trustworthy business. I have bought several items from them in the past and have always received courteous service and help.   Ordering and deliveries are carried out like clockwork and I was kept well informed about my orders via my online account and through regular emails from dedicated and friendly Sales team.  Where I needed to return goods, this was carried out without any quibbles. The Returns Department are very efficient too, and provided a Returns Form and pre-paid labels to simplify the return of packages via Parcel Post.  
My one disappointment was when I bought a used lens which did not focus correctly and had to be returned,  A second replacement lens also had a similar fault.  I was assured that WEX had checked both lenses before they was sent out, but this was clearly not the case. However, I was able to return the items, without hassle and at no cost to myself. .

"Excellent, Except for the Packaging","I purchased a portable SSD and an expensive LaCie RAID from Wex online.  The items arrived on time via Parcelforce 24 in a sturdy box.

Air bags had been used to pack the items inside the box but, unfortunately, they weren't up to the job.  The shipping box was undamaged, but had apparently been dropped and the weight of the RAID had burst the lower bags, leaving both units with little effective cushioning.  The bottom of RAID's own box was distorted, presumably from the impact.  That said, both units were undamaged and work well.

Two used transactions,"I bought two used cameras.

- Fast delivery without hassle
- Well packaged
- All items promised were present and correct
- Minimal time to wait on the phone
- Transaction processed quickly and efficiently
- Staff good to deal with

The D300 was, in my opinion, better than described.  I was very pleased with everything about it.  The lens bought at the same time was equally better than described.

The D800 wasn't as impressive.  There was more paint loss than I was expecting, and due to a lack of photos I couldn't see it before I bought.  While paint loss was mentioned in the description, there is more than I was expecting for a camera with a low shutter count.  There is also a slight dirt spot on the mirror, I haven't fully tested the camera yet due to weather, but based on the D300 I'm sure the sensor will have been cleaned to a good standard.  The writing on some buttons (AF-ON, AE-L) is slightly faded which wasn't mentioned in the advert.  One of the plastic strap guides that clicks onto the mounting loops is also broken, but not mentioned on the advert - though I can't see these being essential or particularly expensive, an irritation more than an issue.

Positives though - wear to the rear screen was mentioned, having inspected myself, I cannot see any wear to the screen - just some usual scratches to the screen protector which is something to be expected.  I also can't see any wear to the base (paint loss as mentioned above aside).

Overall I'm happy enough to keep the D800.  My constructive criticism would be to upload more large photos of each camera as words don't always do the cameras justice or show the potential damage.

I've given a 4 star review because of the lack of photos and a slight optimism on the written description of the D800.  Perhaps I feel it was a bit optimistic because of the D300 far exceeding its description.  Both cameras were rated an 8 for condition, and I would say that they are absolutely not equal.  The D300 is definitely better than an 8.

This is by no means a negative review.  I would have no issue recommending Wex and would definitely use them again.",,2020-03-09T19:35:05Z,4,James,,5
NIKON Photography Equipment,"I'm very satisfied and happy with Wex Photography Video's efficiency in speedily completing my recent Orders. BUT ....
My Orders also included three 'Out of Stock/Back Order' items (Nikon 500mm f5.6E PF ED VR AF-S Lens;  Nikon MB-D18 Battery Grip for Nikon D850; and Nikon MH-26a Kit with Adapter BT-A10) which Wex says I will be emailed to advise when the items are in stock.
I'm aware that these particular items (and, I assume, others) are currently scarce in the UK's Photography Equipment industry, generally. But as one of the UK's leading suppliers, even if only to maintain good customer relations, I strongly feel that Wex should consider posting periodical  'status updates' on its website (say, monthly?) showing estimated delivery periods. This could be based on their internal knowledge, expertise and expectations, taking account of the (short/long) lengths of their own 'Waiting Lists' at any one time. Otherwise, customers like myself currently have no idea if we might have to wait one week or one month or one year or forever!",,2020-03-09T12:00:19Z,4,Don Mooney,,5

I knocked a star off for the very last transaction. I ordered the new Canon 1DX mkiii and a 24-70. Total order ¬£7230.
The camera was delayed (no fault of wex). I got a call from them on a Friday to say it was in stock and they appreciated my patience but also the card it was supposed to be shipped with was out of stock. I agreed to take the camera anyway and wait for the card. The person I spoke to asked when I could take delivery and we agreed it would be the next day (Saturday). Just to make sure we were on the same page the agent confirmed a weekend was ok.
I waited in all day for a delivery that didn‚Äôt happen.
The camera arrived on Monday. No big deal but don‚Äôt promise what you don‚Äôt intend to do.
Basically Wex chose to cheap out on paying the Saturday delivery charge on a ¬£7000 order! Not great. 
My advice is don‚Äôt over promise and under deliver. If I was told Monday in the first place that would have been fine.",,2020-03-03T10:31:11Z,4,Stuart Etheridge,,1

New lens and review of 'pre loved' Canon equipment.,"We went in for a specific Nikon fit Sigma lens having already done our research and comparisons on line and checked that Wex had it in stock.  The sales staff were very helpful and duly supplied the lens that we had requested.
In addition, Wex's consultant reviewed a number of Canon lenses and a D550 that we wished to trade in.  Regretfully the lenses were not found to be in a condition that Wex would have been comfortable to re-sell but the Canon body was taken in.
The consultant was not available when we called in but we left the second hand equipment with them and he called us the next day.
It was good to see the extent of the investigation that was carried out on equipment that Wex would be required to guarantee.  All in all a professional operation that instills confidence and quality.",,2020-02-21T20:01:24Z,4,Jon Fisher,,3

"A trusted supplier but be aware of possible issues with USED, BOX OPENED items.","I wanted to give WEX a 5 star review as the ordering and delivery process was as usual, great. I ordered a Wacom One Creative display that was described as used but only because the box had been opened. The display basically looked new and looked like a great buy until I tried to register it. Then some problems started. Wacom was appearing to bar access and I thought something was wrong with their website. It turned out that somebody else had registered the Wacom One which caused problems trying to get the included software downloaded. It was quite obviously a customer return but not mentioned on the WEX advert.
I was pretty disappointed that WEX had not told me this might be a problem. However, I managed to get Wacom to agree to reregister and open the software up when I sent them my WEX invoice. Luckily they see WEX as a prime supplier of their products. Due to this I have raised my score from 3 stars to 4.

Got incorrect advice,"Got incorrect advice about the internet trade in process, item pricing, and cash back offers in store. This resulted in me missing out on a deal that would have saved me over 265 pounds on a camera kit. 
The extra ¬£265  put it out of my price range so I ended up buying the camera without the kit lens. There was supposed to be a ¬£70 discount on the camera I bought which was also not applied. I complained and got the ¬£70 refunded but I‚Äôm still annoyed at being left having to pay a about ¬£300 more than necessary to  buy the lens separately.

Edit: Customer service were great, they contacted me and figured out a way to give me all items for the original deal price.",,2019-12-20T18:09:11Z,4,K.B,,1
Overall Very Happy,"I was very happy with the overall service. I would suggest one improvement for 5 star service: the item I ordered was out of stock, this was fine as the page said it's normally in stock in 5-7 days. I didn't bother checking for a week, then started wondering what's happening. Logging in told me the item was ""awaiting stock"". This could be improved if there was an estimated time frame for when it would be available - it could save customers needing to contact WEX. The item arrived in stock the next day and I was kept fully informed of the delivery. The item was packed very well.",,2019-12-20T16:18:46Z,4,AP,,4

"A rare failure for Wex, but it is an exception.","Good as always but two stars knocked off this time for some really irritating failures. (One star since added back for Wex‚Äôs follow-up reply. I also genuinely think that a two star reduction was too harsh).

Firstly, I ordered my goods to be delivered to Wex Kennington for collection on Friday. Original confirmation told me that they should be ready from 3:30pm but I‚Äôd get an email to confirm this. I didn‚Äôt get the email so had to phone to confirm that the goods had arrived, that‚Äôs the first niggle. But that was when I was told that Wex Kennington closes at 4:30pm on Friday, not 6pm as advertised so that was a really irritating error. So I had a mad scramble to get to Kennington from Wimbledon where I was working before they closed. So in reality, I had at best a single one hour window on Friday to get my goods, which is pretty poor. That also deeply annoyed me, as I had specially arranged an early start and finish for my Friday shift, and if I hadn‚Äôt known of the early closure or if my shift had slightly overrun, I would have had a totally wasted journey.

Details matter. On this occasion I regret that Wex got them badly wrong.

Despite that, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to make further purchases of new or used equipment from Wex and would certainly recommend them if asked by other photographers.",,2019-12-13T17:14:09Z,4,Robert,,18

I only bought 5 items from Wex because prices for the three ND filters were much lower from other suppliers. I would have preferred to buy everything from one supplier. Wex has a wide range of products, is easy to deal with and delivers quickly but price differences of more than 20% are too high to ignore. I dealt with two other suppliers who delivered exactly the same products in about the same time as Wex.

Part exchange,"Collection of items for P/Ex was very good and was informed very quickly two of my items needed repair, fair enough, but what seemed excessive was the cost of those repairs in particular an administration charge of ¬£25 plus VAT for each item, whilst this in effect not a charge levied by Wex themselves it reduced the value of my P/Ex by ¬£300.  I accept it was my choice to go for the repair but in all honesty what choice did I have ?, if I took them back I would then have to go through the whole process again with another supplier, who would in all likelihood have to send them to the same repairer (Fujifilm).

Then to compound it I received an email saying my account had been credited with x amount, this being the full amount excluding repairs, I thought this was wrong but still ordered my new item leaving a small positive balance on my account, my item duly arrived well packed as usual, I then received another email  saying my repairs had comeback and the credit on my account was now x amount less ¬£300, meaning I now owed them this ( which I knew in reality ), being an honest soul I contacted them to pay them what I owed, although I was sorely tempted to wait whilst they asked for it.  When I did ring to pay what I owed I first contacted the sales office were the credit amount on my account still showed without the repair costs, I was then directed to the P/Ex department who listened to my tale and agreed that yes I did owe them so I settled the amount then, they also said they would delete the positive amount from my account.

On the whole I would still recommend Wex to anyone, but would caution to be wary of repair costs and credits to accounts.",,2019-11-13T12:54:22Z,4,STEPHEN DOHERTY,,13

Replacement eyepiece for X-T2...,"I ordered a replacement eyepiece for a Fuji X-T2. There are 3 sizes available, short, medium (standard) and long. I ordered the standard, medium one, but Wex sent me the long one which isn't as good for a spectacle wearer. I could have sent it back for replacement, but when I checked availability it was shown as ""out of stock"" so I stuck with the long one. They'd have got 5 stars if they'd sent the right one! Service was brilliant, as usual, apart from sending the wrong size. 
02/11/19; In reply to the comment from Wex; Sorry, but there are definitely 3 sizes, the camera comes with the MEDIUM (M) as standard.",,2019-10-29T13:05:00Z,4,Spuds,,29

Express Delivery...Not!,"UPDATE - Since reviewing, Wex have been in touch and refunded the postage charge as I didn't receive the service paid for. Also promised to take it up with their AM - As I mentioned in my first draft - I don't place blame at Wex's door but to ParcelForce. I will continue to purchase from Wex as they are a premier group to deal with. Thank you for the refund and getting in touch. Great Effort Wex! Impressed :0)
...
I paid for express or next day delivery via Parcelforce. Although I can accept that this wasn't necessarily Wex's fault but I waited longer than the next day. I ordered on the Thursday expecting to receive the order on the Friday but had to wait until Mon before the item was finally delivered. My issue is simply that I could have opted for the slower delivery and would have received my order most likely on the Monday. Therefore, I've been charged for something that was not provided. Again, I point out that this is not necessarily the fault of Wex but is disappointing nonetheless when a service is paid for, that service is not provided and there's no accountability for it. Effectively you are pointed to a disclaimer stating that next day is not guaranteed! Why offer the service then? Poor indeed",,2019-10-24T17:20:04Z,4,Martin Yuille,,9

As the order had not been delivered  by late afternoon  Tuesday  I called your call centre and was told  that the filter  was out of stock
and not sure when it would be so my whole  order was not sent .
I was not informed  of this delay  at all

Also told that your carrier  didn't  deliver on sundays but I believe  they do

used camera purchase,"I have used Wex many times in the past with complete satisfaction with their great service, good communication and careful and accurate assessment of used photographic kit they advertise on the website. This time there was a muddle with the listed item and I received the wrong camera. They dealt with this in a considerate and friendly way and kindly included an SD card I presume as compensation for the error. My only reason for a non 5 star review was the communication was not as comprehensive as before and there seemed a slight level of lethargy in correcting what was their error. They are probably very busy but I will continue to use them as they provide great, friendly and honest service",,2019-10-16T10:39:49Z,4,Chris ,,6

Great Binoculars my other Zeiss were stolen.,"Very poor lanyard lens guards top and bottom and solution not sufficient for a Zeiss. This I had 40 years ago with an excellent mint Trinovid recently stolen. Old lens rain guard was adequate and effective. Otherwise  Excellent Zeiss binoculars supplied via WEX. Shame about the inadequate lens rain guards.

4 Stars,"I bought a camera from Wex by telephone rather than online as there were a few questions I wanted to ask. As usual the service was excellent. The only reason that I have not rated 5 stars is that I paid extra for next day delivery but the camera did not arrive on the next day. Fortunately this was not crucial. When I rang up they were most apologetic and it seems that there was a communication breakdown between sales and the warehouse. Suffice to say the camera arrived before nine o clock the following day and the extra payment was refunded instantly. I have bought various items from Wex in the past, will continue to do so in the future and would not hesitate to recommend them.",,2019-09-04T10:42:19Z,4,SW,,15

My last purchase was reasonably expensive and when I rang up with a question regarding a gift from Olympus i was given the wrong information which led me to a course of action where another visit to the showroom was necessary at a time when my time is required doing other things. The problem was sorted out quickly and efficiently and i ended up buying something else on my visit to show that i appreciated the resolution to the problem. On my initial show room visit to make the purchase a young female assistant helped me and was excellent, nothing was too much trouble for her and she showed great patience over a long period of time. This is usually the standard met from WEX but on this occasion the support from customer sales over the telephone fell short.

Would‚Äôve given 5 stars but...,"When I completed my online trade in quote I put that there was no charger with my px camera, I was happy with the quote so decided to go ahead. When I spoke to the trade in team I advised I‚Äôd found the charger and would be including this with my camera. On receipt of the camera I was contacted and given a px value ¬£40 less than the original quote and was advised this was because no charger was included. I explained there were two chargers included, one third party & one Nikon wired charger, the type that charges by connecting a cable to the camera, I was told that this wasn‚Äôt the type of charger they wanted and I should‚Äôve sent the type that holds the battery. I pointed out that the original quote online was minus the charger so I couldn‚Äôt understand why ¬£40 was being deducted? I also mentioned that the px team I originally spoke to never specified that the charger should be a certain type? The lady spoke with her manager and agreed to honour the original quote. Everything other than this was spot on with excellent customer service. I would definitely use again and would recommend despite the hiccup I experienced, it was quickly resolved.

I have used Wex for many years and‚Ä¶,"I have used Wex for many years and never had any issues with the quality of the products delivered. All orders (in my case camera equipment) have always had adequate protective packaging to ensure a safe transit from warehouse to customer, something I look for when purchasing expensive equipment.

Their customer service team have always been able to answer any technical queries about equipment prior to purchase and as a professional Photographer this is important to me. There have been a few instances where I have had to cancel orders and a quick call to their office and it's taken care of.

The reason for a four star rating however is due to Wex using Parcel Force as their delivery service. I have on some occasions been sent a tracking code only for the parcel to arrive after the given time slot where I then missed delivery, even though I paid extra for next day delivery. I must state that this is not a fault with Wex directly, but more to do with their nominated delivery supplier. Because of this, when placing high value orders for equipment which I need in a hurry then I will use an alternative camera supplier as I can track the delivery to my front door at the time slot that was allocated, but for everything else I will continue to use Wex as my main source.",,2019-08-21T09:49:29Z,4,Dean F,,2

I purchased a lens adaptor (¬£579) on‚Ä¶,"I purchased a lens adaptor (¬£579) on the Sunday via the website for 'next day delivery' (which understandably would work out to Tuesday, because of the time I placed the order).

Only additional hurdle was on Monday morning, I received an email from them asking to send in a copy of my drivers license to ""verify my identity"". I called their number on the website to check it was a legit request and not a scam/phishing attempt. The person I spoke to was helpful and said it was just because it was my first order, but yes it was a genuine request.

So I took a picture of it and sent it to them at 12.45pm and at 1.24pm received an email back thanking me for the copy and saying it would now be processed and dispatched.

The item arrived the next day (Tuesday) as planned.

So, ultimately I understand the need to do verifications like this for fraud prevention, but given the amount of things I ordered from different retailers that weekend (many costing much more than the lens adaptor) WEX was the only retailer that requested I do that. 

To surmise, it's not a complaint or even a gripe but just something to be aware of when ordering.

Also, the staff - both on the phone and in their email communications - were very friendly and informative.

My only two minor issues on this occasion were :- The item web page had a box to ask questions of the product, which I used, because the item picture did not match the description - this took more than a few days to receive a reply. In the interim I telephoned WEX and the person I spoke to obviously did not have the answer, and did not offer to ring back. I am sure just a one off and with all the products available it is impossible for staff to know everything.",,2019-03-08T10:58:41Z,4,Lincolnshire lad,,18

I was overall happy with the way I was‚Ä¶,I was overall happy with the way I was treated and how accommodating Wex were in making my trade-in/purchase experience as seamless as possible. However there is a caveat. For others considering trade in be wary of the initial quote. Perhaps I should say if its sounds too good to be true it is. My initial unseen trade in was pretty good & apart from on a couple of items was in excess of other competitor offers. However once the kit was sent in via their free courier service the final sum deteriorated significantly. Now just because you are paranoid doesn't mean they are not after you....but it was suspiciously evident that the final value for trade in was about ¬£1K under the total value of my initial order. Maybe coincidence & clearly seeing is believing so fair play quoting blind can never be accurate. My point here is caveat emptor. Just be aware. Don't rush into ordering based on the initial quote. Have a budget for your purchases & be sure to have funds to cover any shortfall. Maybe over order so the order is way in excess of your final planned purchase perhaps a little deceitful but may counter the possibility of biased final valuation versus expected sales. You can cancel items at will at the point of finalising the total transaction. Make sure you get two quotes maybe three but again understand you still need a visual appraisal to confirm final value. Maybe I was the naive one here and if so then this may just help minimise any pain for others considering the same in future.,,2019-03-08T10:04:57Z,4,Gerard Sexton,,5

Only slight drag is they were not good at keeping me informed of status. The Z6 was supposed to be shipped end-Nov and it wasn't until towards end-Jan that the stock was in. There was no information in the interim. I contacted them directly but they were unable to give me any firm idea of what was happening (it would have been nice to have received an email from time to time to say that the camera was still not in stock and they'd be sure to let me know when it was and perhaps why there was a delay). Then again, I contacted Nikon directly in Dec and even they couldn't give me a date when the stock would be available in the UK, so hey.....)

Need for inspection before sale.,I purchased a Nikon  TC-14 E 11  1.4  Teleconverter which was delivered promptly and  appeared in perfect condition on inspection.  After mounting it on my Nikon 7200 and attaching my 300mm Nikon lens to the front I go a big surprise as the lens rocked up and down. On checking I found the 4 lens mount  screws so loose they were about to allow the mount to detach. After tightening them with my  smallest screwdriver they are now good and secure. Things should have been checked before being sold to me.,,2018-10-09T22:12:57Z,4,Mr HOGAN,,12

"Good CS, could probably afford to lower pirces a smidge..","Wex have always been on the slightly expensive side as they used Caulmet prices as a bench mark... and they we're always needlessly expensive them selves.   I had my reservations when they merged with Calumet as I have no fond memories of dealing with them.  Despite this Wex's customer service has been decent through out and they tend to share their profits with many competitions, blogs and information, but lets not forget it also grows the brand.  I can't lie however in that I only go there for specialist bands that have few dealers in the country and are the same price across the board, as it's easy to shop around and beat your average camera body else where.  In general they're a good team who are always happy to try and help where possible, and as said they do try and give back to the community, but it's not an easy industry to be in and to not watch your spending.",,2018-09-06T22:05:26Z,4,Russell Tierney,,27

When my order was placed on Thursday 23 August the online ordering stated that it would be ready for collection after 4.30pm the following day.  I collected my order at approximately 2.45/3.00pm on Tuesday 28 August.  However in defence of the 'click and collect in your local store system' there was a Sunday, a Bank holiday Monday in the mix.

Usually,"Usually, I would be giving top marks to Wex, always extremely helpful, definitely my go to camera place. However, after purchasing a used lens, which after reading the condition review written by Wex looked great, the usual wear marks for a used lens etc, they failed to mention the awful clunking noise it made during auto focus, this, even though it did not effect the images, would of discouraged me form buying it as I like my equipment quiet, I provide remembrance photography and the last thing I want is the awful noise whilst I'm working with families in very sad situations. The lady I spoke to was very helpful, provided me the returns label etc but sadly a replacement would not be making it's way to me as quickly as I needed it to causing me to have to postpone work.

Paid for next day delivery and was informed by them by text that the delivery would be within the hour of a certain time.  Checked on their tracking service, and sure enough the van was in the area and had passed the end of our road to make a delivery further away. Had not received the delivery in the next hour so, checked the tracking again and the van had returned to where he had delivered before passing our road. In order to do this, it had to pass our road again to get there. The van then disappeared from the Tracker. 
Phoned Parcelforce and was informed that the driver had run out of time to complete his deliveries as he had pick up priorities to fulfil. I said that surely anyone who pays for next day delivery should be given priority.  They said that should be the case and could only apologise.  The parcel did arrive the next day but we had to cancel plans that were made with other photographers.
Phoned Wex and was informed that should this happen again, to contact Wex, and they would deal with the matter saving me time and peak rate phone calls.

I made the payments about a week prior to the  weekend I would use them. 

Upon receiving my invoice on top of the cost of renting the lens for ¬£35 I had been charged ¬£56 for having them delivered a cost I had not been made aware of. 

I quickly complained to them and I was told I was informed in a telephone conversation I had had earlier with them which up until now they haven‚Äôt been able to prove, I followed up with an email a week ago and it doesn‚Äôt seem like a response will be coming through any day.

Wrong Item Received,"This was not my first purchase from Wex, and the service was first class as usual.

A battery!? How hard can it be!!,"I purchased a battery just before opening time on a Sunday, choosing collect in store with a message to the affect of ‚Äòa message will be sent 2 hours after receiving the order to say it‚Äôs ready to collect‚Äô 
I went to the city to shop and be closer ready for a message only to wait until nearer the end of the day with no message. So I decide to go in and try collect anyway only to be told ‚Äòthere‚Äôs only 2 people downstairs at the weekend so you‚Äôd have been better to reserve and collect in store‚Äô (not getting a discount in that process) 

I understand people have other jobs to do but how hard can it be to process an order and get it ready to collect, it‚Äôs a single battery. The lad who served me said it may take a long time to sort it out as I purchased online but he was back within minutes, so it can‚Äôt be that hard. 
Also, if that is the attitude/work process for a weekend then it needs to be made clearer on your website that you may as well wait until a weekday to purchase online if you wanted to collect that day (I work a 9-5 job so I can‚Äôt do that)

Then on the Monday they announce that if you bought the same camera you got ¬£130 of free equipment. Aparantly cyber Monday beats Black Friday!

Wex Photography is great for photography but...,"If you are looking for photography equipment and advice or If you are looking for video equipment and know what you want, Wex is excellent. 

If you are looking for video equipment and need some help, go elsewhere.

A couple of times I have popped into their store when I've been in the area (4 hour drive) and asked video related questions and they have been useless. Their customer services come across very good on the phone and extremely helpful. I have just taken the biggest step in my life and bought a Canon C100 mkii with atomos ninja 2 and trusted their recommendations of lens. Canon EF 24-105mm f4L IS II USM Lens. Very disappointed, no face detection, poor in low light with unreliable AF and noisy focus. I get better results from my old Tamron lens.
They didn't tell me The Atomos would need a hdmi lead and an adapter to fit on camera.
When I went to collect the camera I also wanted advice about weather to get another radio mic or and portable digital recorder and he said to me ""you know about them than me"" he said just buy the zoom h4n and see how you go.
I'm left with a bitter taste of disappointment. Im so scared to use the camera at a wedding in a few weeks time. I'm not confident it's low light ability or focus ability. Just hope I can practice enough before the wedding otherwise I won't be taking the canon. I wouldn't ask Wex for video related advice again.",,2017-05-18T11:57:53Z,4,David Apps,,9
Unusual experience,"Unusual experience, interpret as you will really, I bought a used, rated 9+,  Fuji x-t10, it had 5 frozen pixels on the sensor that showed up prominent in all JPEGS, wex exchanged, np at all, paying postage, for a different x-t10, this one had 4 frozen pixels on the sensor all showed on JPEGS, so I got a refund, all very quickly actioned and wex were spot on. But I got an x-t10 elsewhere, no frozen pixels first go, and if you read about x-t10 frozen pixels isn't a noted problem... Like I say wex where very good at actioning problem, but I wasted 2 weeks getting essentially faulty cameras listed as like.  I would always shop at wex because they did handle refunding flawlessly, but I would always double check all functionality of any used goods, idk were they sourced this Fuji gear.

This meant I could finish the job I was doing over the weekend.
Sadly, and its becoming a regular problem, my parcel never arrived the next day. This must be the third or fourth time I have ordered from Wex for next day delivery and Parcelforce have failed to deliver.
Luckily, Wex are a very reliable team and they monitor their twitter feed throughout the day and found out that my parcel would now be delivered on the Monday for which they apologised. On the Monday, I saw the Parcelforce van drive past my house without delivering my parcel. With tweets flying backwards and forwards between myself, Wex and Parcelforce, nobody was none the wiser as to why Parcelforce had failed once again to deliver my parcel. Wex for their part did everything they could to track my parcel down and keep me informed even to the extent of calling me and offering to deliver another pack of paper for delivery before 9am on the Tuesday. By this time, I had received a phone call from the local Parcelforce depot and, without making any apology, the manager informed me that someone would be out with in the hour (it was not 2pm on Monday afternoon) with my parcel. It eventually arrived just before 4pm.

Wex, for their part cannot be faulted. They did everything within their power to sort the problem out. they refunded my the cost of the Saturday delivery. All I got from Parcelforce was an apology via twitter. To infuriate matters, the Parcelforce tracking system makes no allowance for their own errors when they fail to make a delivery. Instead, they blame the customer by stating that they will attempt a second delivery when they haven't even made any attempt to deliver in the first instance.

I will continue to shop with Wex because their service is customer service is second to none. I just wish they would change their courier to someone more reliable.A special mention for Josh from Wex for doing the best he could for me under the circumstances.",,2017-02-23T20:37:58Z,4,Mr John Horner,,7

Genuine Nikon Parts,"After dropping my Nikon A900 for which I had a leather case, I could only afford an S7000 for a replacement due to insurance excesses.  I wanted a decent case and the only supplier I could find for a case which included a spare battery was Wex.  I've bought several things from Wex before (Panasonic Cameras etc) and was confident in buying from them again.  They didn't let me down, supplying a genuine Nikon case and battery at a reasonable price.  Pity they no longer handle some of the Panasonic lenses for my GX7.  I had to get my 3D lens elsewhere.",,2017-02-07T09:57:44Z,4,Colin Begg,,15

Great service via the phone ... Packaging not so good!,"The team i phoned for advice on the photographic equipment i eventually bought was very good and honest.
 I would have given 5 stars if it were not for the packaging though. The cardboard box size was (approx 5 times) too large and there was a hole in one corner on delivery!!, and the protective super large bubble wrap took up 80% of the space inside of the box.I was relieved to see the hole in the box was not near the camera and separate lens boxes inside the bottom corner of the box and there seemed to be no damage to my lens and camera body boxes!",,2017-01-23T13:53:14Z,4,Andrew Dejardin,,1

Came good in the end,I ordered a lensbaby  spark with free 0.6 wide angle/macro convertor and 'Bend Your Perspective' book. The lens arrived very quickly but without the free items. I contacted Wex via their Livechat facility and was informed that he free items in the offer were out of stock.. I was offered the option of returning the lens for a full refund or accepting a ¬£15 credit note in lieu of the free items (valued at ¬£80). I chose the refund. A couple of days later I was browsing the Wex website and noticed that the 'out of stock' free items were being offered for sale as in stock items. I contacted Wex by email and to their credit they admitted their error and offered to resend me the lens with the free items by return of post. All items arrived the following day and I am delighted with them. A shame Wex couldn't get it right first time but hats off to them for coming good in the end.,,2017-01-09T22:03:55Z,4,Jim,,12
Always reliable,"Wex is a very reliable and good value  supplier who carry an extensive range of in stock items.

Sigma 150-600mm Lens and Sigma 95mm UV Filter,It was great to get my Black Friday order the next day as promised.  I saved a lot on the Sigma 150-600mm lens .  My only gripe is that I could not claim the 15% discount off the Sigma UV filter as it was on the same order.  I should have ordered this on a separate order to get this.  Perhaps WEX should look at this procedure as I feel I was done out  a lot of discount because it was on one order.  Won't be doing that again in the future. This was not made very clear on their webpage!,,2016-11-30T21:28:45Z,4,Eric Mercer,,7
Good service,"Recently made quite a significant purchase from Wex, there had been an offer on some of the profit gear I wanted with ¬£ 240 worth of free items, and I had the items in my basket for a few days but was traveling and could not get online. 

by the time I went to complete the order, the offer had expired.  Given the over ¬£ 3,000 price tag of the items, the free stuff was a bit of a deal breaker.  I explained the situation and the team seat about dealing with my request to complete the order despite it having expired.  It took a while in correspondence to get it all sorted out, but we got there in the end.

Upon delivery one small item was missing but this was soon rectified and shipped on accordingly.

All in all good service.",,2016-11-15T19:54:14Z,4,Iain Flockhart,,9
"Slight confusion, but otherwise good","Recently pre-ordered a Fuji XT2 camera and promptly received it on the day of release, all appropriately packaged and tracked via Parcel Force. This was all fine.

My main gripe (and reason for docking a star) is that the process to 'cash-in' credits earned by part-ex was unclear. Before part-exchanging, I asked 3 times what the process would be (how would the credits actually be applied). The response was vague and unhelpful.

In the end, I was told by the part-ex team that this would be 'automatic' (as would the trade-in bonus). This proved to be incorrect as Sales told me that I had to to phone it in.  Why couldn't they have told me this right at the start of the process when I asked ? It's not rocket science.

Apart from this aggravation, the rest of the advice and customer service was very good. I would not hesitate to use them again.",,2016-09-14T18:08:11Z,4,Boot7,,9
All good except for delivery,"Good site and you informed us of the update of stock quickly.

However the delivery by Parcel Force on the day we were advised did not happen.  We waited in ALL day and no delivery.  The delivery was made the next day in the afternoon.

"Great stock, great service, poor carrier","The Wex element of this purchase was exemplary - they had the stock, gave a good turn-in price, discounts, helpful phone-calls. Straight 5 from that point of view and I'd use them again like a shot.
However Parcel Force let them down pretty comprehensively - turned up twice to collect the part exchange and then missed the specific delivery day for which I'd paid extra. Also their website didn't admit to anything being out for delivery until after it had been delivered. Many couriers now send you text or email specifying delivery, on the day, to within about an hour. Time for a new courier?",,2016-07-20T17:56:12Z,4,Allan Prys-Williams,"Swansea, GB",3
poor aftersales which did get better,"The order experience for my sigma 150-600 lens was really good and i have never had any issues at all with any orders from wex always delivered on time and we'll packaged.   However 2 months after light use the zoom is jammed completely and needs repair.  I understand wex policy but I have a holiday next week which I had specifically purchased this lens for as I am watching wildlife I have never been near before and may not have a chance to ever again, they didn't seem interested at all.  They have no loan lens to cover the period of time of repair which is 4-6 weeks which would have been a bettwr result as I would not expect this issue to have occurred with light use within first 2 months which must have been faulty when sold and my understanding is that it on on the onus of the seller to prove otherwise.

07/07/16 update, Mark in aftersales really great, got in contact to try and resolve and did seem to listen.  I would give them another go based on this communication in the end.  I have changed my score to reflect this.",,2016-06-15T09:39:14Z,4,Adrian,,15
Great service,"I ordered three products, but unfortunately they sent one wrong item - It was a Sony rear lens cap I ordered but was sent a 58mm front cap for something else - When notified they immediately offered to rectify order but sadly this was a stock mix up and the item was currently not available in their warehouse - I needed this item immediately as travelling so cancelled that part of my order
At all times WEX kept me informed and refunded my money - 

Great and polite service and I will use them again - and recommend the company to others",,2016-06-12T18:30:49Z,4,chris,,5
Worth waiting for,"When Panasonic introduced the GX8 camera I was interested but not at the price listed, I did however go and look at one and decided to wait until the price was more realistic. Thanks to a WEX offer, that time occurred recently and I am now the owner of the above model and pleased with my initial hands on experience.  
It is heavier and all round slightly larger (about 5mm) than the GX 7 but I find it easier to hold.  Their are still the odd button that you catch (the display keeps changing in my case) but hopefully I will learn to avoid it.  The similarity to the GX7 is such that  I have had very little problems learning to drive it, and up till now I have not missed the Flash, only time will tell in hat respect. So all I need is some good weather days to fully test it out.",,2016-06-02T17:34:38Z,4,Peter,,3

Online Order with No Problems (Telephone Assistance Abrupt),"Over the years I have purchased a few items from Wex both online and also gone out of my way to visit the store in Norwich and always had first class service. Although recently when compiling a few items there were a few items not in stock on my wish list, so I thought I would ask the question on delivery for these items. The call was rather abrupt, ""when we get them they will be available"" and when asking for a time scale I was told "" when we get them they will be available"" I think someone must of been having a bad day.

Delivery improvements,"Overall service with Wex is very good and the pricing and availability is second to none. The one are I would like to see improved is the choice of courier. My orders recently have been delivered by Parcel Force. Although a National and recognised company there level of service is far below some of the better ones out there. They adhere to the policy of ""we'll turn up when we feel like it and you better be at home"". In this day and age when we are all busy and have lots to do this is not acceptable. Other companies provide on-line tracking, named drivers and route indication. They even have the chance to change the delivery ""mid-flight"". This would be a far better method to be associated with rather than one stuck in the 90's.

Efficient supply of photographic items,"I have used Wex for a long time, and always have great service.

One slight glitch - no longer deliver to Ireland,"I've bought from Wex before and always found them to be excellent.  However, when I put in my most recent order (March 2016) I discovered that they no longer deliver to southern Ireland (where I live).  I rang them up and the person on the phone was very apologetic and helpful.  He mentioned that other customers have used a service that forwards parcels from the UK to Ireland.  He did not name one but at least I discovered that there is such a service.  I managed to track down one (Address Pal).  I got my goods sent through them.  This has worked a treat and I got the goods within the week inclusive of the time for the parcel to be forwarded.  Not too bad.  However, to use this service one has to put in a reference number which has to be on the parcel.  This was not very easy to do on the Wex site - there are restrictions on the numbers of characters in the fields for address when ordering that make this a bit tricky.  
Goods arrived in good condition.  
I'm happy to use Wex again and to recommend it to my Irish friends although I will have to tutor them in how to get their purchases to Ireland.",,2016-03-24T10:33:50Z,4,Colin Bradley,,5
Surprised,"This order was for several items 2 of which were on back order, however WEX failed to advise me when items came into stock.i had to contact them upon seeing that all my order was in stock and the surprising part was the reply received back 

""This will still be showing as Back Order on your account as we had not heard from you as to when you would like delivery for this, however upon further inspection I can see that for some reason an email notification was never sent to you to let you know of this.""
 This implies that it was my fault for not notify them but only that I checked to see if items were in stock I received no communication from WEX

I hope that this problem is now sorted as I have another order awaiting stock",,2016-03-21T18:33:32Z,4,The Laurels,,2

Normally 5 stars,"Having ordered many times from Wex and have always received the item as expected in the condition expected and on this occasion that happened to.
However this time stress became a factor as the lens i ordered for a shoot within a tight timeframe did not go to plan because of the IT system did not show what was happening, my lens was in packing for 48 Hours.
With a Sunday delivery booked and confirmed and needing to leave Monday for the shoot knowing it was on route was very important.
Upon calling Wex on Sunday when it opened it was confirmed that the lens had been dispatched and i got a tracking number which sadly then needed a further phone call due to parcel force not updating there information easier.
The other disappointment was an almost flippant comment when i mentioned that the system was not updating and having a comment that well it happens occasionally did not help.
Should i have just gone out to the high street and brought the lens in my hand job done possibly.
In the end the lens did get delivered Sunday and my shoot went to plan though i did get a very nice email on Monday telling me that my lens had been dispatched and a tracking number, only a day and a half late.
Maybe the IT systems at Wex are still adjusting to having to work a 7 day week.
For such a good company normally a black mark, would i use again of course, would i use if i know i must have the delivery probably not.",,2016-03-02T18:23:14Z,4,Clive Liddiard,,2
Good but greater consideration should have been given to packaging,"As I've most always experienced with Wex, a decent and easy shopping experience. The product I was after was competitively priced and the delivery options are plentiful. My only disappointment and cause for concern was that a NAS external hard drive was enclosed with no protective packaging and would have been free to move around the larger box that contained the rest of the order. Fortunately, the drive appears to be responsive and healthy, although I will be keeping a keen eye on it.",,2016-02-29T17:00:16Z,4,Matthew Lee,,3
Accurate info. Painless ordering. Competitive pricing. Speedy delivery.,"The WEX website doesn't yet have user reviews of the particular Nikon camera i'd later settled on. So, for my own peace of mind, i resolved to independently carry out a little extra research elsewhere.
Though their website did have fairly extensive & relevant Nikon product features, specifications & accurate stock status info. 
It was listed at a fair enough price, but which offered better value when bought simultaeously with a memory card.
Once i'd decided which camera would meet my nephew's requirements best it was a doddle processing the order. And after payment had been confirmed early on Monday morning, i'd received the camera within three days.
We put the camera through it's paces on a day out along the Thames, Tower Bridge & The Tower of London & it was obvious my nephew couldn't be more thrilled with his new gadget.",,2016-02-22T22:13:48Z,4,Bob Sherazi,"Purley, Croydon, GB",6
Delivery charges,"I have always had to pay a much larger delivery charge for next day delivery which I require as I always want the item asap. When I am spending nearly ¬£1,800 on an item I think it is a bad policy - perhaps on an item worth for example ¬£1,000 a next day delivery charge should be worth giving away to help keep your regular customers. I have over the last few years spent what I consider to be a lot of money with you - wouldn't it be nice to give something back to regular customers?",,2016-01-27T21:42:59Z,4,Neil Treloar,"Bognor Regis, GB",2
Set of Lenses for Canon,"I've ordered set of lenses for canon and delivery was very quick. Items were well packed and secured - as usual. I'm very happy with WEX customers support- they are always very honest and helpful. It's not my first buy from them and not the last one either. What could be improved is the option of having 12 months interest free repayment on more products (hence 4*). It would honestly push me to spend more money :) . The 24 months option is in my opinion far too long. technology ages too fast this days... 
Right, and now a few words about the lenses:
1. Canon 16-35 f4 - really great lens, very sharp from corner to corner. I primarily use it for long exposures with 100 mm filter system from Nisi. AF is fast and precise- no issues at all. The lens is well build and performs very well as for now. 
2. Samyang 14 mm f2.8 - fully manual lens with great picture quality for the price. Despite of what you can read online, this lens is very simple to use with Canon. It doesn't communicate with the camera at all therefore you can only use it in manual mode. I use it for long night exposures mainly. Optics and build quality are very good. MF ring is very precise and we'll set up - I can fully rely on the focus distance marks. No issues at all. 
3. Sigma 50 mm f1.4 art - love it! Very heavy and cold in touch - made of solid materials. AF is very precise and fast out of the box, not as fast as some canon lenses but fast enough for wedding and portrait . Very quiet and pin sharp from corner to corner. 100% recommended. 
Bodies used by me: Canon 5d m3's

Trustworthy company,"Over the years I've purchased a lot of photographic equipment from Warehouse Express. They're a top company and I have no hesitation in recommending them.

Relatively smooth part exchange,"I wanted to part exchange my Canon EF 100-400 lens for the new version.  I was given a provisional value of ¬£550 over the phone for the old lens but after it had been inspected I was told that it had possible moisture inside and that, even though this would not affect images at all, it would need repair by an authorised Canon repairer and could cost around ¬£160.  I am not an expert so I decided to take their word for it.

In the event, I was quoted ¬£300 and, although greatly disappointed, I decided to accept this.  The blow was softened a bit because there was a ¬£250 part exchange bonus offer at the same time.

The whole procedure from first contact was about 4 weeks - the initial inspection and eventual repair by the Canon repairer took 2 weeks of this time.

The final invoice was strangely laid out but, since I had paid the correct amount on my card, I was not worried.

The new lens arrived free of charge, well packaged and within a reasonable time.  I would recommend Wex but be prepared for possible disappointment when part exchanging.",,2015-11-04T12:45:52Z,4,Paul,,17
Great offer combined with reasonable part-exchange,"Took up part-exchange offer for Canon 7D Mrk II including trade-in bonus and free tripod.
Plus points - trade-in offer was good and the free tripod was excellent value
Minor negative for me is that having offered a certain value for the camera obviously dependent on condition I felt Wex were a bit harsh on reducing the value (by ¬£50) on that offered due to a few scratches. Especially considering I supplied a camera that worked, the original box, the leads, the manuals etc.
Would be wary of using Wex part-exchange again - but apart from that have purchased several items from Wex and the service has always been very good.",,2015-11-03T16:47:04Z,4,Jane Addey,,2

Good item but unenthusiastic staff!,"I was looking in the used section and had noticed a Canon 1d mkiii.
I read the description and looked at the pictures but there were a couple of little things that I would need to establish such as if the picture showed a reflection or an actual mark on the screen?
I phoned and asked the question about the mark/reflection. The lady said `It could be just a reflection`. Could be or is was my reply! Not sure was the reply. I then thanked her and decided not to buy the item.
Then I kept thinking about how I liked the camera but needed to establish if the picture was showing a reflection or a mark.
I phoned again and a gentleman said it was a reflection.
Great I thought and asked my next question. Is all the software complete? I think so was the reply! Can you confirm if it is all there? The reply was the description says the software comes with it. Yes but is it all there?
I gave up. I thought long and hard and took the decision to buy the camera and it turned out to be good but with little or no help from the staff!
Once these issues are sorted this company would be 10/10 as they under sell the used goods in that they are better than rated by them.",,2014-08-23T09:04:43Z,4,Andy Robertson,,1
Very poor start but a good recovery,"Received a quote for part exchange a couple of weeks back but felt the quote was a bit too low. Last week the price of the Fuji X-E1 with 27mm lens dropped in price and decided to go ahead with the purchase. I asked for the item to be reserved until the part ex went through.
Today I received part ex confirmation and called this evening to purchase the Fuji kit. I was initially told there was no reservation (by the same person that reserved the kit)  and eventually that they did not sell the 27mm with a kit and that I must have been mistaken, as he had reserved a body only.
I was then passed to sales who at least confirmed that the Fuji was on sale the previous week with 27mm lens but that I wouldn't have got it anyway as they did not have enough stock to fulfill the orders.
At first I could not believe the incompetence but on further reflection I do believe I was given the runaround and the camera kit had been sold in the previous week. Not had as poor service as this in the last for a long time.

Now I have to wait for the return of my (part ex) camera and start the search over again, after spending time packaging and having someone wait in for the courier to collect. 

Update: Was contacted by Mark the next morning who offered to source a replacement camera and send it next day delivery. Received next day by 9:am, thanks Mark/Lee. Should have been like this 1st time but will look to do business in the future.",,2014-07-01T21:19:21Z,4,gavinc,,1
Very quick and hassle free!,"I have ordered a few things from WEX now, as well as part-exchanging a lens, and I have found WEX to be, on the most part, swift and very reliable.

So far all orders which I have made, from flashguns to lenses, have been a pleasant experience. Not to mention, I have been kept up to date with events and seminars which I may find of interest whilst following my creative passion.

In short, I would very much recommend WEX Photographic to anyone that is looking for equipment which pertains to photography.",,2013-09-14T13:02:23Z,4,shootthereddot,,4

Cancon 5d mk3,"I am very happy with my Canon 5d mk3 and 24mm to105mm lens .
I cannot say the same for the Canon strap that Came with the camera unfortunately  I think Canon could do better.

When I bought the camera it was advertised on the website has a camera that the box had already been open so the camera is reduced in price On the webpage there were showing that there would be some software I would come with the camera When I asked the gentleman if this was going to happen he was not certain and would send me an email to cry situation He did send me an email Saying I would not get the software Considering this is the advert show the software on the web page I thought Wex would honour that I also thought that you would not have to pay the postage and packaging
Delivery considering The overall cost of the camera.",,2013-08-16T19:00:43Z,4,Malcolm Anderson,"Birmingham, GB",1
Great service but..........,"I always purchase my photographic equipment from WEX.
As always it was a pain free experience the website is very intuitive and all went smoothly. I asked for a Saturday delivery and paid ¬£7.50 for this privelege but the goods came on Friday! If I didn't want a Saturday I could have gone for free delivery in 3-4 days maybe I will give a full five stars if I get a refund on the wasted Saturday cost?",,2013-08-10T13:14:34Z,4,Mark Dell,,43
"Great price and quality, but not suitable for all wide angle lenses.","Bought the Cokin ND ""Z"" set as I needed larger ND filters for my full frame camera.  On any lenses wider than 20mm the filter holder intrudes into the frame.  This is disappointing as I wanted them principally for my Nikon 16-35mm.  I cannot afford the Cokin ""X"" range and if I could I'd have bought Lee filters.

A lesson learned, but I can use them fro 20mm upwards.  The quality is good and they are presented well. Docking one star as the Cokin sales blurb mislead me.

Wex remain my first port of call as their service is second to none.",,2013-07-18T12:52:12Z,4,Robert Walker,,4
Hard search but delivered well.,"Although I like Wex photographic for its wide palette of offered product, it was relatively hard to find some of the accessories. Wex should probably give more attention to improving the quality of their database.

On the other hand, my order has been completed quickly and delivered well.",,2013-07-01T13:47:36Z,4,Honza Chyl√≠k,"Norwich, DE",2

Excellent,"Excellent speedy service, everything arrived more quickly than expected. 

One minor quibble: I received a misleading email which said I had to call Wex to guarantee delivery . I called, was told delivery would be sent that day,  my order arrived later the same day!. It seemd an unnecessary call and whoever answered the phone should have known my order had been posted,",,2013-03-25T12:54:11Z,4,Gary Weightman,"Onchan, GB",3
very good and prompt delivery,"The buying experience was excellent and the goods were delivered next day, however they just let themselves down by offering  the same camera discounted a week later, after i bust my budget, thanks a lot Wex, otherwise you would have got 5 Stars",,2013-03-14T22:42:57Z,4,Robin Griffith,"Chester, GB",7

Fast customer services response and low prices,"Ordered from Warehouse Express because of their low prices and fast delivery.  As it was my first order I had to provide proof of address however this was dealt with quickly and did not delay my order. Parcel ""Farce"" unfortunately are their courier of choice who messed up the next day delivery in every way they could - after I informed Warehouse Express of this, who were not at fault, they refund my delivery costs.",,2010-02-02T17:41:38Z,4,Pete,,13
"Decent Service, expensive P&P","Phone uped, gave correct price, and delivered next day, the site even gives youa  count down until how much time you have got till the next day ordering finishes.",,2009-03-09T23:43:40Z,4,John Andrews,,1
