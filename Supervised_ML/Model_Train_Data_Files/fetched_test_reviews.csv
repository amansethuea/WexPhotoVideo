"I sold a camera lens online to Wex after receiving quotes from a few camera stores.
They offered Â£305 based on my own rating of the camera condition, and this was subject to their checks of the lens.
I was pleasantly surprised to be paid Â£315 instead, presumably as the lens was in better condition than I had ranked it.
Clearly a very honest, trustworthy company that isn't in it just for the cash.",2024-06-25T07:09:23Z,5,Trustpilot

"Good:
Easy to navigate/search for products.
Good prices for both new and used items.
Quick detail entry for creating initial account & checkout.
Fast delivery.

Not so good:
Web page was slow to move back to checkout after creating account. Possibly webpage & iOS compatibility issue or just a ""glitch"".
No email confirmation required for account creation seems like a potential security risk that's easy to fix/implement.",Sat Jun 22 13:06:35 2024,4,PowerReviews
