Zero packaging,"Zero packaging. Bought an expensive scanner. The box arrived with no packaging, they just stuck some paper adhesive tape over top seal on the box and an address label on the side, relying on the boxes existing packaging to protect the contents.

The goods were thankfully not damaged, more down to luck, but the box was torn, gouged and dented in several places.

Considering how packages and boxes are treated in transit I find this unacceptable. Should have been placed in a bigger box with buffer material (air filled bags, polystyrene chips, etc).

First and only time I'd use this company. ",2024-05-25T00:00:00Z,2024-05-31T11:34:03Z,1,Carl Ritchie,,8

Very disappointing considering what was advertised.,"I bought a used lens with a 9/10 condition rating, with only light cosmetic wear noted in the description. The lens arrived on the assigned day (the only positive of this whole experience), only to find that that window for the focus dial was held on with tape (which was not mentioned at all in the description) and the autofocus did not work at all.

The second was a girl who had no idea what she was talking about and kept trying to fob me off with nonsense to get off the call.

Honesty is the Best Policy,"I have bought many items from WEX in the past, but last few have been disappointing. Firstly received a lens which was seemingly not the one in the photo, and not in the condition I expected, and now, received a valuation on a trade in, that they graded as a '6' with  value reduced accordingly, only to see the item appear as a '9' on the site when for sale, with a value to match. And this wasn't the only issue with this transaction. Time to move to a dealer I can trust",2024-04-03T00:00:00Z,2024-05-03T17:29:52Z,1,Eamon Durey,,8

I don't trust them,"I've dealt with Wex, (previously Calumet) for many years both personally and through businesses. I thought that they were completely trustworthy.  I was recently having a clearcut of  cheaper camera gear with a view to buying  a Black Magic set up with lenses for film projects so I took some photographic gear to Wex, Edinburgh. I left the kit with them and they came back with a value of around £550. I wasn't entirely happy so I took the gear back. A couple of months later I took a camera, a lens and a flash to them thinking that I would part exchange it against the movie setup. These were in original boxes and I have the receipts. There had unfortunately been a break in to the Edinburgh store, so they couldn't assess the gear, (the same gear as before) within store and had to send it off. That wasn't a problem for me. What was a problem was the next valuation of the kit as £301, thereafter a final valuation of £72. To add insult to injury I was then told that my camera was a grey Import, (It was bought in John Lewis Edinburgh) that the flash was rusty, and that the lens had mould in it. All nonsense. I was informed that they would happily dispose of the lease and flash for me. (To use a local colloquialism, ""Aye Right""). I realise that this is a business and they have to make money but this is beyond the pale. I asked for my equipment back and they agreed to send it. I received it a few days later to find that the charger was out of the box and the cable was missing. I informed them. They immediately dispatched a charger, which wasn't mine and bore no semblance to the one I'd sent. When I contacted them to ask whose it was they just replied to say that they would send another.  In short I thought that I was dealing with a professional company who valued their customers and in particular valued the merchandise. Clearly Not. The camera, flash and lens have now been checked by a reputable dealer who has passed them all as absolutely fine and in working order. I have left the Black Magic camera, lenses and other equipment which I was going to buy in the checkout bin and am now buying them elsewhere. I will not be dealing with Wex again for any of my photographic or sound equipment. I personally don't trust them.  Update:
In regards to the reply of : your equipment is older, the problem is not the age of the equipment but the complete nonsense about the condition of the equipment which has been inspected since and sold to a reputable dealer for a fair price. It isn't difficult to assess the equipment and it's very easy to make up excuses for poor service. Wex can say what they like in reply to this. I have voted with my feet and bought my new equipment elsewhere.

Used sent as new,"First equipment sent out as new was clearly used (OM1 camera body). Referred to their service arm for a lens but told by the service centre that they do not repair Panasonic lenses.

Having now received the replacement, all is as it should be and it powered up in the state expected ready to select country and time. The previous device had already had this done and to another time zone so clearly it had been used by someone at some time before shipping. The other indicator was a greasy thumb print on the LCD display. I had originally decided to cancel the order completely but having experienced a very positive response to the issue I decided that I would be happy with a replacement and this conversation too was very positive.
The idea of giving me an extra battery was welcome until I found out that it was an Olympus look alike rather than an OM Systems battery. I may well have been fine with that but was surprised when I saw it. That coupled with the repair information is what led me to one star. If the last two things had not happened it would have been a 5 !",2024-04-25T00:00:00Z,2024-05-01T14:03:41Z,1,Paul G,,3

"Waiting for an order for 3 months, website estimate still says 5 days.","Ordered a product on 10th Jan 2024. It showed as out of stock on the website but the estimate displayed would be in stock in around 5-7 days. 

It is now exactly 3 months after the initial order, the website STILL shows an estimate of 5-7 days. 

I only receive automated emails saying they’ve not forgotten about the order. Each time I have to contact for an update I have not yet received a helpful response.

Estimated time to get stock is misleading and I have missed our purchasing with other suppliers who now no longer have stock either.

"Damaged my camera, lied about it.","I took my camera in to a local wex to exchange it for cash. I inspected it, a photographer friend did, and also the man at the wex store. They quoted me £348, needing 0 repairs based on their initial inspection at the shop. Which was signed by the employee. It was sent off to wex, I received an email saying the camera was damaged therefore they would be reducing the quote because they needed to carry out repairs. Let me point out, I am a professional photographer, who works as a photographer, and have a camera in  my hand 8 hours a day. I know cameras and I know if one is broke or damaged. The company damaged my camera and I asked for it to be repaired by them, they refused and sent it back to the store. Upon collection I told the man at the store about what had happened, his response was that I am not a professional and wouldn't know if it was damaged. Which is laughable. Upon inspection, it is clear it is now indeed damaged, one of the dials is extremely loose. This happened after it was sent off and the company completely denied it, even though I have a signature from their own staff saying it wasnt in need of repairs. Besides being completely dishonest, they are also insulting. Do not ever use this company. Ive used them for years to buy camera equipment from but it is clear behind their professional veneer, is criminal behaviour. Ive read reviews where similar instances have occurred.

You've sent me a cheap. dummy battery version to d-tap version I could've bought on amazon for £10 and the pins on it aren’t even functional. It would break my small hd monitor if I tried to use it.

Part Exchange Is Very Risky,"I have been a Wex customer for five years and spent in excess of £17k over that time. I've had a number of Part Exchange transactions which have been OK. I recently bought a new camera body and traded in my old one. I was quoted a price which seemed fair. I took the camera to the Milton Keynes store as I do not trust couriers. I was given a receipt for the camera but it was not inspected. A few days later I was told the camera's LCD screen was damaged and needed repair. I explained that the camera was not damaged when I handed it into the store. I'm an honest person who would not dream of attempting to trade in a broken item, but that counted for nothing. I discovered that I had no protection after handing over my camera to Wex - all the risk was mine, which is not acceptable. I was quoted £180 to repair the screen or simply get back a broken camera. I accepted the quote as I could see no sensible alternative. The quote then increased significantly but once again I could see no alternative. No details of the repair quotes were provided. The transaction is now complete and instead of £750 trade-in I am left with about £500. Do not trade in your goods unless you are prepared to accept all the risks or you are able to prove that your kit was fully functional before you hand it over - you will have no comeback. I won't be spending any more money at Wex.",2024-03-18T00:00:00Z,2024-03-19T11:05:40Z,1,Jorganmeister,,1

Don't bother they will just ignore you…,"Went to the Milton Keynes store with intention of confirming my internet research then buying a drone. I prefer to see and touch and support local shops before a purchase. Especially one of several hundred pounds.

After a few minutes I left. Clowns waved at me as I left. They did not want my custom. 

Maybe I don't look like a camera geek?  Maybe I did not look like I had a spare grand to spend. I don't know which off their prejudices I triggered or they were just rude.

Next day delivery for a small item,"Next day delivery for a small item. Received 6 days later, delivered to the wrong address, had to pick up from the neighbour. Wex Photographic not much use, it appears that once it leaves them they have no influence over the delivery. 
I suspect their published delivery schedules work very well for the towns and suburbs, not to well for anyone living in the countryside. I would also guess that their delivery agent are hanging back on the delivery in order to maximise their profits. Unfortunately, I think that Wex only have one delivery agent on their books, in order to maximise profit returns. Might as well stick with the Royal Mail .

Ripped-off with trade-in/resale price,"Until recently, I would have probably awarded 4 or 5 stars, as I have been very happy with business over many years. However that's drastically changed when I recently traded-in my 8 month old mint condition Nikon z7ii. I trusted the price they offered was fair, although lower than I expected. They agreed with the condition and paid me. I was looking on their used section at Z8s and was appalled to see they were offering same condition Z7ii's for almost £600 more than they paid me, a 45% mark-up. That's around 3 times new product mark-up I feel absolutely fleeced. This is profiteering to the detriment of customers.

Awful Customer Service,"I organised a Trade-in with Wex and arranged a date when they would send a courier to collect my parcel. The courier (DPD) did not arrive on the agreed date and time. Unfortunately, there is no Customer Service phone number on the DPD website for me to contact to get a resolution. I had to take time off work to wait for this collection so I contacted Wex to find out if there was anything they could do. Wex told me they could not help and that I would have to contact DPD, who I can not contact because they do not provide a Custmer Service phone number on the DPD website. Wex eventually gave me a number for DPD as at this point I had already made it clear that I could not take anymore time off work on another day, so I needed DPD to come back on the day they had agreed. After speaking to DPD they told me that they could only re-arrange the collection via Wex and I would have to get back to Wex myself. Also, DPD were not prepared to come back on the agreed date to collect my parcel even though they had not arrived at the agreed time. I got back in touch with Wex once again, eplaining again that I was unable to take more time off work to wait for a collection on a different day. There was still time on the agreed day for DPD to return, but they would not do that until I had re-arranged it with Wex. I needed to re-arrange the collection for the same day because of my work committments, as I had already explained to both Wex and DPD. I simply wanted Wex to contact DPD and tell them to come to collect my parcel as they had ignored my previously arranged collection time, but I needed DPD to collect on the day that had been arranged. Wex simply refused to tell DPD to come and collect as was arranged. The process of resolving this issue is impossible if I have to contact Wex first, then DPD, then Wex again because nobody will take responsibility for resolving this issue. As a result I will never Trade-in with Wex again because I am concerned that the same thing will happen again.

Poor service,"Arrived at Edinburgh store where there was one other customer.  Went to the accessories display, was passed by an assistant twice, no acknowledgement, on second pass they went to sit back on a seat behind counter.  Asked for some assistance, they grumbled something, but I was unable to make out.  I had two filters and asked what the difference was, both UV.  They went back to the seat and then shouted reply to me.  If had had not needed this part for upcoming assignment, would have left.  Bought only part, but had wanted other equipment.  Guess I will give my business to somewhere else.  Poor service considering I have bought all our gear there.

Swindled,"Wex removed the cash back instructions from the product page shortly after my purchase. They didn’t email me any instructions on how to claim either, so I ended up searching for Panasonic sources on how to claim. Confusingly, Panasonic was running multiple claim sites, and unfortunately I ended up trying to use the wrong one initially, and the delay caused me to miss the claim window. After some emails from Panasonic promotions support I was directed to the right URL but unfortunately it was too late to claim so I reached out to Wex for help. Sadly, while apologetic, their view was that it was very much my problem, and I should have checked with Panasonic for instructions… This was a Panasonic offer, nothing to do with them. They couldn’t really help. I felt this to be most unsatisfactory, as they were quite happy to use the offer to sell the product. Quite happy to have their company logo displayed on the Panasonic website too. I shall not be purchasing anything else from wex.",2023-12-09T00:00:00Z,2024-01-09T20:15:18Z,1,Peter North,,1
Missing component. I wouldn't buy from them again.,"I bought a battery grip for a Pentax KP  but a component was missing. I don't recall any mention of this in the listing  and my recollection is that it was graded 9+, which to me suggests it was in excellent or at least very good condition. It had clearly not been checked. Fortunately the return was straightforward, though I haven't had the refund yet. I wouldn't  use them again. Edit: Refund now received. Thanks very much. The response I initially had from Wex when I received the item with the missing component was that components may be missing from traded-in items, and that this would be noted in the condition tab on the website; the implication being that I hadn't looked carefully.  I have no recollection of seeing in the original listing that a component was missing from this item. The impression given in Wex's intial response was that missing components is the norm with second-hand items; to be expected. I still don't think I'd feel confident buying used equipment again from Wex. Further edit: I now see the battery grip is for sale again, at the same price, after my return: listed 9+, described as ""near mint"", and with a description that clearly says it ""comes with grip L"", the component missing when I bought it. If they are now able to sell it at the same price, but now it comes with the grip L that was missing when I bought it, why were they not able to send me the grip L when I said it was missing? It couldn't  be that their description is still inaccurate and misleading, could it? Even after the apology published here saying there was ""an oversight"" that was going to be ""rectified""? If you're tempted to buy from Wex, proceed with care.",2024-01-02T00:00:00Z,2024-01-08T10:19:36Z,1,Mr Peter Marsland,,21

I am not sure if other's have this harrowing experience like me or not, but Wex have a tendency of sending same order in multiple shipments and then loosing track of them. Although  they provided a timely service for delivering goods from their online warehouse but when it came to deliver out of stock items from their physical store, there was a catastrophe of failures and mismanagement of the whole order, and after half dozen of emails and they could only deliver one. And when you receive text like they are going to do CCTV checks and staff you feel that there is a breach of trust and a blame game being played by the company for loosing track of the shipment.",2023-12-28T00:00:00Z,2024-01-03T16:43:30Z,1,Jay Ray,,3

And they announce they closed my WEX account after two decades of purchasing this they let my know about on Trustpilot. They could of let me know this by a private email. But they like to  humiliate. Over the years of shopping with WEX Ive heard different members of staff bad mouth just about every camera brand on the market. This gives you a no vote of confidence in your purchase and have a go at you for returning goods because of this reason even when unopened under there returns policy. They should take responsibility for their words and actions and retrain sales staff about selling to the public and their arrogant manner that when a customer tells them they have have had a lot of experience with camera equipment over the years and photographic   knowledge.

I made a recent purchase of a canon R5…,"I made a recent purchase of a canon R5 and RF24.70 F2.8. And was questioned by Paul about why I was spending my
money on these items of which i had already made my choice. He then proceeded to brain wash  me into thinking I had made a bad choice and went on to suggesting alternatives as if he deemed my purchase a bad choice. When i did not ask for any advice  or invite him into a conversation he forced himself on me to listen to him anyway. I just wanted to make a payment. He then went on to forcing his opinion about other camera gear i already owned and telling me how i should  use it. ETC my camera has 8 stops of image stabilisation  and updated algorithms to insure clinical focusing but insisted it should be on a stand.  He worked me  up and insulted my intelligence that much I returned the goods . Its not the first time wex have forced opinions bad mouthing cameras or lenses that i have purchased from them, then later returned because i have not wanted to take out the box leaving me with a bad feeling about equipment. I  have purchased . I could write a book about there poor advice and arrogance after twenty years ,they have even commented about  returns that I have made.well within the 45 day return period money back guarantee, condemning me on numerous occasions ,I will be shopping else were I am given advice when i ask for it with respect. And  be able to go out and use my gear and be happy about my choice with confidence.
After 20 years doing various aspects of photography , weddings, studio work I know enjoy landscape and street photography.So i have a broad spectrum of knowledge  of photography and how to use different cameras.From starting at college with  a coke can [pinhole photography] through to DSLR  and know onto todays mirrorless cameras . So you can understand why I do not like being spoken to like some halfwit. i have read your reply about last item ordered, Terry sales manager listened to phone conversation and agreed that in this situation the comments made by Paul where uncalled for, Today Peter has replied on trustpilot and commented about returns if your records where looked at you would find that the reasons for returning R5 in the first instance some time back  in its infancy, was because the camera the top plate display vanished , i couldnt change the aperature setting and shutter would not fire, then the LCD screen went off and the camera shut down completely, i was told to return this under faulty goods,I had a refund ,since this days have gone by I read good reviews on the R5 and that any initial problems would have been rectifed I wasnt worried about the video over heating as I wouldnt be using video. I had already traded in my Z9 because I deemed it too heavy and bulky for carrying on long hikes and climbing mountains in UK and abroad , 11 to 12 thousand feet , Sierra Nevada , Dolomites etc,I thought long and hard about this for weeks and thought it was a good deal with the double cashback from Canon and then when i wanted to pay for goods. as i said earlier Paul put me off the camera completely trying to push dearer items with no cashback deals as good as the Canon R5 at the time. When the goods arrived I cant bring myself to open the carton the items were in because all I could think of was the comments that Paul had made,I have returned items in the past unopened with security stickers still intact, and on other instances you have discounted  a percentage of my refund, Example camera returned never used bought for around £3000, you gave my £2000 back, the last lens I bought of you Sony GMaster 50mm F1.2 was returned because of the condition it arrived in, multiple scratches and mark on the lens box and on opening found the bag around the lens was all ruffled and it was clear that it had been taken out of the box and the lens itself had particles of dust etc. i blew this off but then decided that I didnt want to keep it as it could of easily been used, maybe a trade in.WEX have never lost a penny , even deducting  money for returns . As for closing the account Im not bothered as after the last episode i had decided that I wouldnt be buying from you again anyway.
Word of warning do you research , shop around before you make a decision on your purchase.",2023-11-30T00:00:00Z,2023-12-04T23:29:24Z,1,Mike,,7
Order by telephone and collect in person  donot rely on Couriers especially DPD,"The recent two order made with Wex are both of nightmares
Wex have been failed by their delivery service via DPD
the first order the delivery driver refused to hand the goods over as he had not seen me come to the door and refused to delivery. 
The goods finally reached me via the use of the local Post Office and came with a significant crushed and damaged box  
Thankfully, Wex had packed and cushioned into a box that was oversized. Clearly aware that DPD do crush and throw boxes and deliveries around. 
The Post Office commented that I was fortunate that given the poor weather of recent time that the packaging was wasn't water damaged as there had been ones that been on earlier delivery and the packaging was soaked. 
I have made complaint to WEX about matters and my complaint remains yet to be resolved 
On the next occasion in the light of delivery difficulties i asked for the Parcel to go to the Store in Leeds appex an hours drive from where i live and again DPD failed in its delivery as they took the Parcel to the store at a stupid time prior to the store actually been open.
Sadly, the attitude of one of  the Wex Customer Service team  was the comment that that sadly was to be expected and i had no reason / cause for my complaint as that is the risk of on line ordering
I did finally collect from the Leeds Store and that t have now i finally received both Orders 
However the entire process for both orders was totally unsatisfactory and as yet Wex still are to address and resolve the complaints made
The Leeds store staff were more than helpful and the comments here bear no relation to them and they informed me that DPD are an absolute shambles as a courier and delivery agent. The Store as the front customer facing part of the Wex business  were ashamed and embrassed by DPD  that if I want anything further to speak direct to the store staff to progress and not rely on the DPD to meet requirements 
What is of concern is that if I had needed /  required  items as part of rental for photo assignment works (those for whom the work was to be undertaken could have been let down.and caused significant problems for me)
This may be  exceptional but has caused me to raise complaint and as yet such both these complaints remain to be resolved 
After spending considerable monies with Wex i had hoped for a better and more proactive response than what has been afforded to date

Update
Thank you to Wex for reading the review and taking the time to then call / contact me 
It is hoped that the recent events will be addressed and that issue around the poor service afforded by DPD will not impact further on yourselves

Totally lost my trust in their service and will not be using them again.  They actually only lowered the quote by £100 so it wasn't about the money.  I'm just shocked that it would come down to this. Had been happily using them for over 8 years and my experience and reviews had been positive until now.  Not sure if loyalty amounts to much anymore.

"Good offers, WEX part ex absolutely awful.","* WEX replied to my original review on Trustpilot saying they would “be in touch” they haven’t. Avoid WEX part exchange like the plague. 
I’ve had to update my review due to trying to trade in goods. If you’re buying new then see the first section, if you want the bad parts please skip down the review to part two. 1: Good offers, exceptional delivery, fast and efficient. There was an issue with my selected delivery and my location, a staff member phoned me very shortly after order to explain and discuss alternatives. On the website there’s an amazing selection of new and used. 2: part exchange. So I bought a new camera and used the Partex form to sell my equipment I no longer need. The online form has a drop down menu to select your gear however not everything you want/need to sell is on there. They send a free shipping label for DPD to collect which is great so all I had to do was box and send it all off. I sent every last piece of Fujifilm equipment, accessories and boxes I have in my possession as it’s no longer useful to me. All items visually look as new, all items have the original box, original packaging and all original accessories with each item. Sent the box away no issues. Next time I hear from WEX it’s to say there’s accessories “missing”. Wrapping cloths and chargers. Every single thing I originally bought and received from WEX where this kit came from was in the box. The X-T3 kit I sent back supposedly is “missing” the UK plug for the charger. When I bought and received the camera from WEX 3 years ago it was never in the box. They are adamant it was. So I’ve asked if my items a genuine UK model after calling them and the chap on the phone was very short saying they only sell genuine UK equipment from Fujifilm UK. I’ve been in touch with Fujifilm UK with my serial number to check if my item is as stated, a genuine UK model or a US model or different as I now suspect. When I bought the camera and opened the box originally the box had the factory seal and I was disappointed it needed an adapter for me to charge the battery. This was my very first Fujifilm camera so my thoughts originally were its odd it didn’t have a UK plug but it’s also a Japanese company so maybe that’s why it only came with a two pin plug. I still await Fujifilm UK’s response to my serial number query.  So my quote was reduced for “parts missing” I never had in the first place. Secondly there’s a “wrapping cloth” missing from my X-T3 half leather case, when questioned I got the response that they “found” it again. And now for the fun part. I also sent away a xf 100-400mm lens which is the most expensive item I own. This came back after the appraisal as being “damaged”. I’ve been told there’s “heavy moisture” in the rear optic. The lens is stored in the same bag, in the same place and used in the same locations as all my other kit which has come back as being fine. So I questioned this and was told when going from cold to warm locations the rear optic “fogs up”. I asked for any evidence of this and I wanted pictures or something, anything, when the lens was sent away it was in my eyes, and I checked it, in perfect working order. I got back a quote for repair for some £200+ odd but zero evidence. So I rang them and I was told once the kit has been checked the first time they don’t check it again and won’t photograph it or show me any evidence of what they found. So I’m now thinking they are trying to scam me. They quoted nearly £600 trade in, down graded the lens and said it needed repairs, so at the end of the day once (if) I paid for repairs I have no idea it needs or not I would get back £200! So I declined and had the kit sent back to me. All my stuff was sent back via Parcelforce on 24hr express on the Monday, I never received it until the Wednesday, when it came the Parcelforce delivery driver said be careful with the box as it’s all come undone. He handed me a cardboard box with the bottom and top fully open! He photographed the box open on my doorstep and I took it inside. When the box was taped closed it was taped with 3/4 of the tape missing the joints so it’s busted open. I checked everything inside and luckily for me and WEX everything was present and correct. I’ve checked my xf 100-400 and for the life of me I can still not see any moisture, even when going from hot and cold areas, I’ve checked with a magnifying glass and cannot see any evidence of any moisture inside. So my take on this is, be cautious if your trading kit in. If your most expensive item comes back as needing repair don’t just jump straight in and pay it, it might not need it, and if your buying new just be 100% sure the item you buy is actually the UK item you intended to buy. Not sure if WEX is a scam company or not now but anyone who won’t supply evidence to back up work is very dodgy to me. They were my go to but I might have to rethink this.",2023-10-07T00:00:00Z,2023-10-13T10:10:35Z,1,LEAIM,,29

Poor Customer Service,"I returned a faulty item (lens) for repair, WEX tried to deny responsibility and told me that my fault was not covered by the warranty. Eventually they accepted responsibility for the repair and sent my lens away for service. When the lens was returned to WEX from the repair centre I informed them that I would prefer to trade it in against a new camera rather than have it back. They then told me there was another fault on the lens, this time the blame was put on the repairers who WEX claimed had striped the thread on the tripod mount whilst carrying out the initial repair. I definitely didn't want it back after this but was offered a trade in price almost 30% below what I had paid 5 months previously. In my opinion the credit should have been for the full original purchase price. I feel like I have been well and truly done over.",2023-09-22T00:00:00Z,2023-09-28T12:11:50Z,1,Les Stott,,7

Trade in is as painful as it can be. Selling faulty stuff and mismatching accessories,"Dropped an item for trade in the Birmingham store. 5 days later I received an email saying one of the accessories was missing, in this case the battery, reason why they offered me £60 less. All of the items were checked at the Birmingham store but I’ve also checked the CCTV in my office and I can see clearly that I’ve put the battery in the box before sealing it, 60 minutes before dropping the camera in the store. Now I got to way for them to sort out this mess.
UPDATE: Apparently the battery was the wrong model and that’s why they deducted £60. Funny part is that the camera was bought from them less than 2 months ago and clearly supplied with a mismatch battery. They agreed to honour the initial quote but since they sold me the camera with the wrong battery it’s their problem and will be requested a full refund of the original order. This is the second used camera I bought that had something wrong with it. First order was a canon RP that had bad focus hunting. After returning the RP to the store didn’t process the refund and I had to chase support to get the refund two weeks after. Clearly used items are not verified properly and on trade in they’re happy to give you less money but sell them at twice the price. It’s a gamble dealing with WEX, you might be lucky and get a gem but from my two orders I got two lemons 🥴",2023-07-14T00:00:00Z,2023-07-14T16:37:29Z,1,Cislariu Lucian,,6

First time customer experience,Went onto the Wex Photo 'Leeds' website on Thursday to check trail cameras. Showed a selection in stock and as a result travelled 27 miles to the store only to be told by staff that the stores didn't stock them as no one bought them. Came home ordered 1 on line and paid extra for next day delivery which was confirmed as 21.04.23. Waited in all day with no sign of delivery. Mid afternoon contacted Wex customer care who after putting me on hold for a short while told me that they had now arranged for a Saturday delivery with a time slot. Waited in again today with no sign of a time slot or delivery of item. At 15.00 item was still shown at delivery depot. I assume I won't be getting it today as the company only delivers until 2PM. Now left not knowing when or if the item will come but I won't be wasting my time waiting in for it. Would be reluctant to use this company in the future.,2023-04-22T00:00:00Z,2023-04-22T16:17:11Z,1,Graham Battye,,2

VERY  disappointed,"I consider Wex to be THE premier new and used camera store. Over the years I have purchased and sold a fair amount of new and used equipment through them. 

Recently I purchased a used XT1 from them only to find that it was defective. I had to return it, which in fairness was a simple and easy process. I opted for credit on my account and purchased another XT1 within the week. The second XT1 was also defective exhibiting a similar problem. I have owned and used an XT1 previously. Whilst it is easy to return, it shouldn't be the case that two cameras from the same place are both defective. Very disappointing indeed. My confidence in Wex has definitely taken a knock. 

On both occasions as soon as I turned the camera on it was apparent that something was wrong. The defects have been detailed to Wex and there is no need to labour them here. 

It is apparent that there is something wrong with the quality control system in checking the used equipment on these two occasions. Previously I have given glowing reviews for Wex but apart from the purchase and return experience (which is excellent) on this occasion I can only rate them as very poor.",2023-02-22T00:00:00Z,2023-03-05T12:35:41Z,1,nigel charlton,,32
Beware of poor devaluing and misleading…,"Beware of poor devaluing and misleading practice!! In store (Bristol) I handed over pristine equipment (9+ condition) and was given a fair valuation. The valuation was still lower than private seller average on e.g EBay. Surprisingly, a week later, some items were valued lower and a repair was deemed necessary on a lens. This knocked almost one-third off the store quotation. I felt I had no option but to accept this much lower price. Additionally, I then learnt even more money would be deducted for a cash payment (rather than exchange for goods). Overall a very disappointing and costly experience.
Looking at other reviews it looks like I’m not the only one experiencing this practice.",2023-03-03T00:00:00Z,2023-03-03T18:04:42Z,1,K from Bristol,,23
Delivery service.,"Your company needs to change the method of delivery. Parcel Force is a complete waste of time. On ordering items over the last few months on three occasions they have been delivered to the wrong address or just disappeared. With the last order I had text messages every morning stating delivery was 12.00 1.30pm the package appeared 5 days later. I challenged one driver and he informed me that, “He did not care”, and sped off with the wheels of the van spinning in the dirt of the road.

I contested that diagnosis, requested the camera be returned and found no such defect. Then WEX accepted they had made a mistake and asked for the camera again. This time, my quote was reduced by £30 for cash rather than in store credit, despite my initial valuation being based on cash. In a nutshell, WEX trade in seems based on a great initial valuation and then a series of ‘reasons’ to reduce that quote once they have the camera.

Just to clarify because it seems to be the companies soul defence, I didn't get to find out if live chat was video or not because it didn't work!

"Sent in equipment, they downgraded and lied about the quality, stole a battery. MPB offered what it was actually worth.","I received a good quote for some equipment, a camera body, 2 lenses and batteries so I sent it in. They decided that one of the lenses was completely broken and wouldn't be paying for it (even ""offering"" to dispose of it for ""free"", along with downgrading the body massively even though it was in excellent condition. I refused as everything they said was ridiculous so they sent it back to me. 

I had initially sent in 2 batteries and only received one back, after emailing them to ask for the other one back I got radio silence so they essentially stole it. 

I then sent the same equipment to MPB who actually offered me a higher quote, they checked the equipment over and actually offered me even higher than the quote, even upgrading the ""broken"" lens that Wex had offered to dispose of for free. I had never had any problems with the lens so I assume somebody was trying to pull a fast one.

I would hugely avoid this company, especially because they seem petty enough to steal a single battery. I'm not sure what they were playing at with the lens issue either as it had been checked and used by numerous photographers all without issue. MPB is a far better company so I would always recommend using them.

Appalling customer returns policy that has lost them a valuable customer,"Been a customer of these guys for 15 years and have spent many thousands with them. I am a pro photographer and often order items I need for a shoot, so these items are business-critical. I ordered a reflective umbrella I needed for a shoot I have in a few days. They sent the wrong thing and then said I would have to go through the whole returns process, i.e. send it back and wait for them to receive and send another. They say it's their policy. What a policy that loses your customers and adds insult to injury. A customer focussed company would send another one straight away and await the return. The computer says no mentality strikes again. A policy based on some dodgy previous customers who didn't play ball and send back on time, so the rest of the decent customers suffer. We live in a world of business and data intelligence - surely you can put a system in to score your customers in some way so you can extend the service to the decent ones and use your computer says no policy on those with a track record of messing you about!

No delivery and poor customer service,"This was the first time I ordered from Wex. 

I ordered a camera and paid extra for Saturday delivery.  Tracking information with parcelforce was quite confusing initially, with disparity between the despatch note and parcelforce saying that the item could not be collected. Thankfully, by the morning of delivery, this had been corrected and it was showing as being ready for delivery. 

I waited all day and the tracking showed that the camera had not reached the out for delivery stage. Per the Wex help pages, it suggested there was a problem with the delivery soi tried to reach out on the live chat but was directed to email instead. Was told a response would be sent in a few hours… but had no response. 
Eventually I contacted the Wex team by telephone and was told that the parcelforce tracking for a Saturday deliveries is unreliable but I should expect delivery.

No delivery was received meaning I will now be without a camera for a planned trip. If Wex andParcelforce had been more forthcoming, transparent and helpful, maybe I could’ve tried to collect from the depot instead.

My frustrations:
No delivery on agreed date despite paying a premium.
Poor tracking data between Wex and parcelforce including known problems with their Saturday delivery tracking.
Advice provided by wex that the parcel would likely be delivered (even though well after parcel force delivery hours, and after the depot is closed) causing me to waste an afternoon waiting.
No response via the live chat 
No response via the email
The faff of having to try to get an order cancelled now, whilst travelling since the camera will not be needed any further and will prob have to buy a replacement elsewhere.

A combination of poor choice of courier, poor systems and poor customer service have soured my impression of wex.",2023-02-11T00:00:00Z,2023-02-11T17:57:25Z,1,Cris,,4

Invites you leave reviews then doesn’t publish them.,"Reviewed two products, neither review absurdly negative or over the top (decidedly not recommendations, either) and they remain unpublished on the WEX website.
This is problematic for a number of reasons - you are invited to do so, so why bother if they won’t feature? The reviews you DO see are plainly only the positive ones, because WEX is selling those items. This is laughably unbalanced, approaching dishonesty.
If you see an item on their site with only positive 
reviews this obviously gives a false impression, if more critical reviews are suppressed.

Fedex eventually delivered a mangled parcel which had clearly been left out in the rain, actually on the 31st Decemeber.

Margins are 'wafer thin' in the photographic business.

Poor service and petty treatment,"Product excellent, service dreadfull. I was assured when I called to confirm you had my part ex camera that I would have a confirmed valuation in 2-3 days. I got it a week later. The revised valuation was £15 lower than the original quote. That's feels petty. You cannot value to within such a small amount and even if you could to exercise that change when I was buying a £1200 replacement from you was insulting. I will be warning others to expect similar treatment and that MBP is a better option!",2022-10-18T00:00:00Z,2022-10-26T12:44:09Z,1,Kev W,,2
Wex Photo Video Part Exchange Team Part Four,"Following my last review Wex stated they would be in direct contact with me, guess what, no call, no email and their CEO, Louis Wahl, who said he was keen to hear of my experience, then when things went even more badly wrong, he just ignores my emails. Speak volumes for where the culture of this organisation comes from!
As said before lots of other great camera retailers and buyers of quality kit out there so use one of them.  I shipped my camera and lenses to Matthew at Mifsuds in Devon. He was a pleasure to deal with, confirmed receipt of my package and less than two hours later he had inspected and arranged a payment to me.

Wex Photo Video Part Exchange Team Part Three,"Following on from my recent posts despite intervention from the CEO of Wex Photo Video the return of my goods, promised for yesterday did not arrive and having waited in all day I was furious.
Received an email from Wex Customer Services, late in the day which said “We have been in touch with ParcelForce regarding the delivery of your kit back to yourself that should have arrived with you pre 12 today.
“Unfortunately they have just informed us that the parcel has now been returned to the depot and will not be out for delivery again until Monday.”
Left my home this morning (Saturday) and guess what ParcelForce turn up with the parcel, luckily my partner was at home to receive a very battered box which thankfully contained all of my kit which appears, at first look, to be OK.
There are many other reputable retailers and buyers of camera equipment out there and I strongly suggest you try anyone else other than Wex Photo Video.",2022-10-15T00:00:00Z,2022-10-15T13:21:25Z,1,Terry Osborn,,69

Their response e-mail said they would get back to me. But they didn't, they didn't and they didn't. Even after phoning them. Nothing.

Wex part ex service - a joke!,"Upgrading my camera so got three online quotes to part ex a camera and three lenses.  Wex were, marginally, offering the most so shipped my goods to them. Heard nothing so, after the maximum three days they quote, contacted them, lots of promises that they would appraise my kit and confirm the quote. 
Cutting a long story short after umpteen emails and telephone calls here we are a whole week later and they haven’t even unboxed it yet.
Have asked for my kit to be shipped back in a before midday service tomorrow so that I can use another, reputable, buyer.
Never used Wex for part ex before, never will again, they are truly appalling.
If you have good quality kit to sell try Jonathan at Worldwide Camera Exchange, inspects same day, pays good prices and the money is in your bank account 5he same day.
Avoid Wex like the plague.

Nice website ZERO service,Purchased a Nikon 800mm from them. Their next day delivery took 4 days. My previous next day delivery from them took 5 days and the one before that took 4 days. The box it was delivered in was gouged and damaged on all sides and had obviously been thrown around quite a bit over its four days in transit. Who knows what damage will have been done to the alignment of the elements or the Image Stabilisation. Unfortunately their customer services couldn't have cared less. If you are buying delicate optical equipment then I would suggest you choose another dealer. Who knows what damage will be done to your lens in transit if you buy from WEX. I have used them for what must be more than 20 years and their service back in the day was second to none. Now it is far far below average. In future I will be purchasing from Grays of Westminster who still provide a service.,2022-09-23T00:00:00Z,2022-09-23T16:23:22Z,1,David MacLeman,,5

An absolute car crash of a transaction,"An absolute car crash of a transaction. The part exchange deal with the Newcastle store was such a convoluted mess I can't even remember the exact details. I wound up having to order the lens I wanted online from Wex because the store couldn't get it delivered, despite them taking a payment from me instore, was told I could use Amex online which was incorrect so I had to use PayPal, and when they finally agreed my PX was worth the value they originally agreed, I had to wait over a week to receive credit against my purchase.

There was a member of staff in Newcastle who was quite patronising towards me and who also made a flippant remark under his breath when I stated I wanted the lens with the original Nikon box. I was in desperate need of the lens for a job otherwise I would have walked out there and then.

I've spent a fair amount of money over the years with Wex but I can safely say that I will not use them again based on this experience.

By far the worst experience I have had…,"By far the worst experience I have had with any seller site out there. 

I wanted to purchase a camera and lens totalling around £3,500 a substantial amount of money, set up an account and went to purchase where I was met with an error. upon this error, I was logged out of my account. 

I tried to log back into the account and was met with another error, so I then tried to reset my password and yet again another error. so I contacted customer support, by far the most useless customer support I have ever encountered. I was told there was no error and they could not help they then proceeded to ignore my replies. 

As for the camera, I decided to phone up and order the camera and the lens, the man on the phone seemed nice enough to take me through the ordering process and took my payment. upon receiving the email confirming my purchase I noticed my name to be spelt wrong (after spelling it out multiple times on the phone) and for the delivery date to not be what was promised. at this point, I did not want a penny of my money going to the company and cancelled the order. the second gentleman on the phone was completely rude and condescending about my predicament and was more interested in trying to keep my order than hearing my issues. 

I insisted on a refund and cancellation and got a confirmation email for the cancellation however the funds they claimed in my bank are not pending for 7 days!! meaning I must wait a week to purchase the exact same equipment just from a seller that deserves my custom.

Part exchange,"Had such a poor experience part exchanging some old lenses for a new lens. After contacting WEX I was told it was ok to take the 3 lenses to the Norwich branch, so I did. when I got there I was told that I could either reserve the lens I wanted or purchase it and once the trade in lenses had been looked at they would pay that money back into my bank account. So I bought the lens whilst I was there. After a few days I was contacted and told that one lens had water in it and they could send it away for a quote to repair, so I asked for it back, when I received it I discovered that it wasn't even my lens they had returned to me. The lens was black in colour, all the lenses I took in where white! All the lenses had been marked down from the original quote even though one has only been used a dozen times and with a lens coat on. Every time I contacted them I got a different person and had to explain the same stuff that they had misplaced one of my lenses and I was also told that the would look after me. They did find the lens which had been put in the wrong order! If I had not asked for that lens back and allowed them to send it off for a repair quote, I would have never known that the lens was not the one I took them! I did ask for a better deal because of all the stress that the had caused and was told they could give me another £100 but they gave me nothing back as more than the £100 was taken off the  original quote. Now they said they would credit the exchange lens value back to my bank account but no one told me that it would take so long to put my money back when I bought that lens from them, Due to how I was treated I will no longer be buying any more equipment from them and I have been a customer that have used them for may years",2022-07-30T00:00:00Z,2022-08-29T15:58:31Z,1,customer,,5

Wanted to buy a double pack of camera batteries. They were shown out of stock, so had to order 2 singles at greater expense which were shown in stock. Instantly got an email saying out of stock.

Customer service rep completely un-interested.,"I got an email asking me for a review of Wex customer service following a call to them. 

If I could give them less than one star then I would. Absolutely useless. Asked if they have an estimated date for stock on a drone. Received computer says no answers to that and other questions. 

I shouldn't have wasted the 25min I spent on hold to speak to a person who was completely dis-interested in my question, had no intention of helping in any way and give me the feeling she couldn’t wait to put the phone down. 

God help you if you had a question or issue on something you received from them.",,2022-06-16T17:47:46Z,1,JKL,,6
I have returned a stolen camera and…,"I have returned a stolen camera and Lens worth £3500 to Wex and they have promised me a reward for what I have done and guess what! they didn't even say thank you.
I have bought canon EosR and RF50mm f1.2 lens from FB market place and after I received them I find Wex rental label on the camera I have contacted Wex the manger of Wex rental Jemma confirmed this equipment stolen from a customer was renting this camera and for me all what I want is to get my money back from the seller and return the camera back to Wex which this is happened and Jemma promised me a reward but she have to get approval from her manger so I left it and when I contacted the customer service they told me another story this camera not a stolen camera this was lost in transit from the courier during delivery from London to Manchester which I'm sure the courier and insurance company cover the costs of this camera and the lens and Wex already get back.
I have called the shop in Manchester and told them the story and they have asked me to email Leatitia the new manger for the rental shop in London Which I did and completely ignored with no reply to my email. 
I still have all emails from every single member of Wex and photos of the camera with serial number.
It's a shame the biggest leading photo/video company in the UK dealing with this kind of situation like that if I have lost my wallet and someone's found it and bring it back to me I will at least say thanks to them not just taking it and ignore them.",,2022-06-10T00:01:35Z,1,EBRAHIM MAHMOUD,,4

Customer service has really gone downhill,"I’ve used Wex quite a few times in the past, probably spent a few thousand over the years and have always been happy with the experience until now. I don’t generally bother leaving reviews but I thought I’d share my experience as I won’t be using them again. 

I ordered a printer and paper and paid extra to have it delivered on a nominated day, not rush delivery, just a day where I’d be in to receive it. I never received any tracking information and waited in all day for a parcel that didn’t arrive. Fair enough, these things happen. 

My main concern is the absolute lack of customer service I received when I phoned to chase the delivery. The first woman I spoke to failed to find the tracking number and said she’d have to “email the warehouse”. Obviously this didn’t happen as I never heard from her again. The only help she could offer was “hopefully it’ll turn up”. 

The second person I spoke to didn’t seem to bothered either, I’m not expecting them to move the earth for one customer but a simple “sorry, let me help sort this out for you” would’ve gone a long way. 

Like I said, I’ve never had issues in the past but I 100% will not be shipping at Wex again after this experience.",,2022-06-01T18:49:01Z,1,Nathan Gillingham,"Manchester, GB",4

Probably the worst camera company in the Universe!!  Had a camera that was 6 weeks old.   Had a small sensor spot so took it for a free sensor clean - got it back covered in scratches and in a terrible state, complained to them. They then sent it away to get a further clean and examination.

On return for collection, it turns out that their 3rd party company had replaced all the interior of it with a  second hand shutter (450,000 shutter count), AND they then Wex wanted to charge me £300 for the replacement job!

Threatened them with court action and they suddenly turned around and said no charge but please leave a 5* review.

I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO STAY AWAY FROM THE EDINBURGH BRANCH AS THEY DO NOT HAVE A CLUE how to clean a camera.

I appreciate the partial refund, but I really would prefer just to have my order delivered as promised. 

Update - it is now Tuesday morning, Monday came and went and no delivery was attempted after I waited in all day for a third delivery. This morning the tracking still says prepared for delivery. So now I suppose I just have to wait to see if this is returned to yourselves even though delivery has never even been attempted. And then I won't get my order at all.

Have found another supplier who's advice is spot on, prices very competitive and products, including used, are supplied exactly as per spec and in full working order.

Terrible service and loss of my monitor,"I purchased an Eizo monitor which developed a fault. The customer service dept advised me to drop the item back to a store and they would sort out a repair. They very kindly collected the item from my address as I was unable to drop it off. All good so far.

I heard nothing for a week, so chased up the repair and was advised by the team that they were unable to repair the Monitor as it must be sent to the manufacturer BenQ by me directly. This guidance was obviously not what I had been originally told. I was also surprised as BenQ were not the manufacturer of my item! 

Wex arranged for the item to be sent back to me and I’d then have to send it off again to the manufacturer (not BenQ)

A week and a half after this all begun, my item still had not been returned to me.

After two days of being told to stay at home and wait for my monitor to be delivered, I was advised that it had been delivered. However, this was not the case.

For some reason Wex had sent my monitor to my previous address rather than the one which they collected it from where I live.

Long story short, Wex lost my monitor and had me without it for almost three weeks.

The outcome was they sent me a brand new one to replace the one they’d lost and also eventually agreed to give me £200 vouchers for wasting my time.",,2021-12-09T10:21:36Z,1,William Corder,,2

After several emails and even chasing…,"After several emails and even chasing up the “I’ll get straight back to you” !! the item I ordered finally arrived over a week later than expected. They even blamed the courier claiming they lost it pretended to refund and sell it too me again like they were doing me a huge favour but after checking with Parcelfarce they confirmed this was nonsense. Try park cameras if you appreciate honest communication.

-  In response to Wex, don’t over promise it will help manage expectations you should have consulted with me as i would have taken a refund. As i explained it was a birthday gift for my niece I ordered a week earlier than needed incase there was an issue. My niece returned to Canada after the dates promised it’s cost me almost £50 to forward this to her and there’s never been any attempt to resolve this dispute with me.

And your response is missing important context that seems to shrug this off as not a big deal and petty for not leaving a positive review.

Not for professionals. Stay away!,"Tried ordering a lens through Edinburgh branch and never got anywhere with them always saying they have no stock (yet you are able to book it on the website???).

Somehow after multiple attempts they got it in and was meant to arrive today for me to pick up.

I took 2 hours of my work to drive 40min each way to collect it and it wasn't even there.

The manager told me it should have been a day before (which makes sense) but it was not.

This is pathetic and a systematic issue they have there. 

I will never try ordering rental stuff from them they just don't want to be bothered with it clearly.

Wex get 1 start because Trustpilot…,"Wex get 1 star because Trustpilot won't allow me to place no stars or less. 

This is just a summary of my experience since August 1st.

Aug 1st: Order monitor with 5-7 delivery  schedule. Receive order confirmation that now said monitor was out of stock even though it had the blue box on the website. Two parts to the order. All delivery details correct.

August 5th.  Delivery dispatch notification received for the second item of order.  However, the delivery address incorrect - to an address I've not lived at for more than 5 years.  I had to collect from Post Office - who let me have item even though I didn't have correct address details that matched delivery item label.

I ask Wex  to ensure for delivery address to be corrected to ensure monitor does not go to incorrect address.

Aug 6th new order confirmation received with correct address for monitor ordered on August 1st.  Still showing as 5-7 days delivery schedule. Still out of stock.

Aug 12th. Wex confirm: ""I can see that we are expecting stock of the [monitor] by the end of next week.""

Aug 13th. Wex confirm: ""Unfortunately, in this instance the Suppliers are unable to give any estimated delivery dates at this time""

November 11th.  Still no monitor or updates of expected delivery.  I cancel the order and order another monitor that has a blue box on the website, showing 5-7 days delivery.

November 19th: Wex confirm ""I will have to ask our purchasing team to see what the hold up is with the supplier""

November 22nd. Wex confirm ""We are still waiting to hear back i'm afraid"".

November 22nd.  Wex confirm: ""I have just heard that your monitor should be here in 2-3 days , there has been a delay at the suppliers end that they have now sorted, but they do apologise!""

November 23rd. Wex confirm:  ""We regret to inform you that we've been unable to fulfil one or more items in your order within our expected time frames...Your products are still on order with our suppliers and we will contact you as soon as we have it in stock.""

So, still without monitor and the monitor ordered ion November, that is now out of stock, still shows a blue box on the Wex website.

Edit: 25/11/21 (17.29) - would have been nice to have received an acknowledgement from Wex of the issues raised.   It'll probably arrive when the monitor eventually makes it here.

In all honesty now, the only reason I am perservearing with this is because my colleagues gifted me Wex vouchers, so I now have to use them or my colleagues hard earned money is wasted.   My hard earned will be spent at other camera equipment outlets in future, based entitely on this experience.

Further edit: 26/11/21 (17.19)

Hello,"Hello. I bought a lens from Wex Photo & Video on October 25, 2021 (Last Monday). I explained in detail the lens model I wanted. I checked the stock of lenses before going to the store. Lens price is GBP1,049. According to the lens model I wanted, an invoice was issued to me and I took the product and put it in my bag. I didn't feel the need to check because I didn't think such a good brand would make mistakes. When I got home I saw that the product was different from the one on the invoice and I went back to replace it. I spent more than 2 and a half hours. The seller was very rude when first buying the item, and then it was there again when I went. He said we don't have that product, then when I insisted, he realized that the stock was due to the wrong product delivery. And at the end of the day, I was able to get the right lens.

We have not had a worse service than that we had received from Wex in regard to our order.This was the third opportunity that we had given them to get it right and they failed miserably!
On the first two occasions, we had driven two hours each way to the Norwich store only then be told that the item was not in stock. Despite a telephone call on both occasions confirming that they had it in stock prior to us arranging a collection.
On the third occasion after a lengthy telephone call we were assured that it was in stock.

True to form the item was not received as promised. After another complaint, we received another reply transferring blame to the couriers. The item arrived on the afternoon of Tuesday 28th September (4 days late) - certainly not a next day/Saturday delivery .

They try to say this is a mistake but I think not as it happens way too often. I would include a screen shot of an offending page but it appears I can't.

Mark. This goes deeper than price fluctuations. If a product goes up by £300.00 over night, I feel it would be courteous to explain that to prospective customers.

Disappointing Service on Recent Order,"Been a Wex customer for years now. We’re always my go to supplier but my latest experience has been disappointing. 

Ordered three items. One was out of stock so I waited until they could all be delivered. Item comes back into stock but then they can’t find the one allocated to my order. Looks like it’s been sold to someone else. 

Had to wait for it to come back into stock. Item back in stock. Now they can’t find another item that was allocated to me in the order. 

Now I have to wait until that missing item comes back into stock. Not confident the order will be completed when that arrives. 

Phoned today to ask if the order could be split dispatched and was told that it would be sent today. Then got a call back to say that’s not possible. The only way to cancel the missing item is to cancel the whole order and reorder again. 

Really disappointing experience. Just keep getting told they can’t do anything about the errors.

"Go elsewhere, the worst customer experience ever received in 35 years …","I’m afraid I received the worst service of any camera store I’ve visited. At the Norwich store, I was left standing and ignored for what seemed like an eternity. When the camera I was purchasing ( Fuji x100v)was finally retrieved, with accessories, by the staff member he just walked past me to another till without even talking to me apart from when he wanted my card to pay . Only then did he beckon me over. No receipt sent via email as promised. Charged incorrectly. The gentleman serving me had no knowledge of online promotion for accessories.
Complained via their website with the answer “ we can’t get through to our Norwich branch, you’ll have to call them or pop in yourself”.
Went back in there and the original ‘gentleman’ that served me (who had a face like a funeral director with piles), told me I would have to speak to the manager who wasn’t in. Said he would get him to call me. No phone call was received. Apparently he didn’t have a number for me ( which I gave when I spent over £1300 on the camera) . Finally received an email from the manager which did not address my issues in any way.
The worst service I have received from any shop, let alone camera shop, in 35 years of photography. I do not recommend them but do positively recommend others don’t use them based on my experience.

Disappointing customer service,"I purchased a tripod online Friday gone, when I got to the checkout there was an option for Saturday delivery. This was perfect for me as my birthday was on Sunday, Saturday came and went no delivery. When I went to Parcelforce website on the Sunday to check the status, I could see it was at the depot.

But I had plans to use the tripod on my birthday and days off as I'm back in work on Tuesday, and Tuesday is the date the tripod is now going to be delivered. 

I sent an email basically saying that's not good enough, you offered a next day delivery service and you didn't deliver, and please don't use Covid as an excuse as you're offering this service. I got a response back from customer service saying that they don't guarantee next day delivery, and that is true Wex does not guarantee next day delivery. What they do offer is a Saturday delivery, so my choice of words was wrong. I replied back to customer service with a screenshot of the check out where you get the Saturday delivery option, saying to them if they can't deliver this maybe they should remove it. Basically they focused on they don't offer next day delivery, I'm a big believer in if you make mistakes fix it don't BS people. Purchase arriving very late, I could deal with.

Disappointed that purchase was not honoured,"Placed an order for a wireless HDMI transmitter and receiver system based on the description on the WEX website which listed it as having 1 transmitter and 1 receiver in the box. 

Due to supply problems, the order was 4 months late which I can understand but the item arrived missing the receiver. 

When I called up, the staff on the phone dealt with it reasonably swiftly but called me back later that day to say that the website was incorrect. Despite the item listed as having 1 transmitter and 1 receiver in the box, the picture on the website showing the two items and there not being an option to order the receiver and transmitter separately - my options were to order in a receiver (for an extra £700) or to send it back and take a refund. 

At the time I had ordered - choosing WEX as the cheapest by £150 - competitors were selling the complete kits for approximately £700. This has now doubled in price everywhere and I am left without what I had ordered as I cannot afford to spend double on that particular product at this time. 

TLDR: Ordered a wireless kit, only sent transmitter, WEX claims the website is wrong and I can have a refund but wouldn’t honour the original purchase of the full system as displayed on the website.

after handing in equipment to be valued…,"after handing in equipment to be valued at the Glasgow store i was shocked that yet again they have tried to undercut their online value considerably. When challenged they just don't know what to say. the optics were clean and true a tiny mark on a lens hood and all the sales man could say was you don't have the original packaging.

I needed a lens relatively quickly and…,"I needed a lens relatively quickly and after a search found one on WEX which stated that if I bought within a set amount of time it would be posted out that day, with next day delivery. As this was the only company who could offer this, I purchased.

The next day I checked the progress and it had not even been sent out. I contacted Customer Services to stop the transaction but was informed that it had been dispatched that day so too late to do so. The lens was bought on 1 July and arrived on 7th July.

Customer services suggested that I return the lens, or not accept it when it did arrive, and they would give a refund. While this was a positive response it failed to acknowledge that I had made a purchase based on inaccurate information on the wbsite as their site was promising something that it couldn't/didn't deliver, which is a very disappointing. 

I also got offered free postage for my next purchase from WEX, which I felt was quite a presumtious response.",,2021-07-09T09:43:52Z,1,GMTP,,3

5 Stars down to 1 star,"In the past I have given WEX 5 stars but
never again.

I have spent £32,000 over the past 7 yrs.

Purchased a used Sony 24-105 lens for £810
the lens was never removed from the box as I had
broken my wrist.

The lens was returned to WEX 7 weeks after purchase
and found to have a mechanical fault and needed repaired.

It was clear the lens had the fault when it was supplied
but WEX would not accept this and only offered £610 for the lens.

The cost estimate to repair the lens was nearly £800 which shows that the lens had a major fault.

If you purchase any items from WEX make sue you do your own testing within 30 days if you want your money back.

I am a member of 2 camera clubs with a membership of 40  and have always recommended WEX for the past 7 yrs ""BUT NOT ANYMORE""

I currently have a Sony A9 with a fault.
the camera is 11 weeks old and WEX / Sony  have had it for the past 4 weeks and nobody is doing much to resolve the problem

No explanation how the lens can have paint loss and gritty when it was ""NEVER REMOVED FROM BOX""

WEX say all used products are fully checked and tested.

Here is a list of faulty items supplied by WEX over the past 2 years:
2 x Sony 24- 105 lenses
1 x Canon 100 - 400 with fungus in optics
1 x Canon 7D Mk2 Debris in viewfinder

Clearly not fully checked  and tested.

Refund received for A9

Lens issue resolved, Settlement deal agreed with a chap called Stewart.

One of The Worst Experiences with Wex,"This has to have been (and continues to be ) just one frustrating company to deal with , from mislaying £950 and taking 4 people to find it ,one of them promising to find it and call me back but you guessed it he didn't ,
At the moment still waiting for the return of a camera which again nobody seems to know which one I am referring to  ... Really ?
Phone calls and emails all seem to just be either ignored or things passed around and blamed on the system,of course blame the new system .
I was lucky at one stage to get Claire who was actually brilliant .
I am now waiting for an SD card ,would not have thought this was exactly  scarce but its taking a long time to be sent out >
I was so frustrated I even took to Twitter ..No reply .
The thing which takes four weeks to arrive I ordered knowing this and yet I recive a reply informing me !
At last I am asked is this camera the one you refer to ? how many cameras of mine do you have,do any of your staff work the same system ?
I give up or will when all this is resolved and I can go elsewhere for my camera equipment.

Thank you for your reply Wex but perhaps having notification of wearing masks on you front door may help, PS I was requested to wear a mask before entering the store with which I complied with out complaint,also no one informed me the that it was card only purchases then I could of used my card, as regards your member of staff wearing gloves I think someone is telling fibs, I see you also ignored my point of one member of staff not wearing a mask please don't make the customer the villan in such cases as regards the one way system a little obvious direction in store with obvious signs may help.",,2021-06-04T11:13:58Z,1,Martii Peacock,,18

Buyer Beware,"This review is not a reflection on the service I have received from Wex. I purchased an Epson SC-P700 colour printer from Wex. Unfortunately the printer did not work straight out of the box. I contacted Wex customer services and explained the problem. I was advised that Epson support were able to resolve a majority of initial problems over the phone. Based on this advice I contacted Epson support. This is my first Epson printer and based purely on the incredible lack of customer service I have received from them, I will not be purchasing another Epson printer. I have been waiting 8 days for a set of replacement ink cartridges from them. When Wex were able to supply the necessary cartridges the very next day.I cannot understand why a company the size of Epson supply cartridges with a new printer, that don't allow for the printer to be set up initially. I can honestly say that from a customer service perspective Epson are the worst company I have had dealings with over the last 30 years.",,2021-05-28T17:41:30Z,1,Mr Leonard Evans,,2
"Order not sent, item became out of stock no update given","I placed an order of an 'in stock' product on Thursday 20th May. I paid £8 for a 2 working day delivery service. By 26th May (4th working day) I'd had no delivery attempts or communication from Wex at all. I called today, spoke to someone to outline the situation and was put on hold for 15 minutes, then advised that whilst there was 1 in stock when I bought it, someone else also bought one so they got the product. I totally get that this happens, but I wonder if Wex at any point would have told me or contacted me? This has severely impacted a shoot booked for 28th May (I had allowed an extra 3-4 working days for any delays or issues). Very lacklustre customer service and poor ordering experience.",,2021-05-26T14:08:55Z,1,Laura,,8
Disappointed in Wex,"I rarely write reviews, and even more rarely poor reviews. This review is intended to get Wex to improve, because they are a good company who provide an important service. However in my case, I've been let down, despite being a loyal customer.

I purchased the BENQ SW321C Pro Photographer Monitor in late April (Order number PO9379653608 ). This Is a very expensive, reference monitor for pro photographers with an extraordinary display that includes 100% Adobe Colour space. 

My monitor arrived just over 24 hours after the order, so top marks for efficient delivery. However I immediately discovered a fault with my particular unit. The USB-C and one of the HDMi slots were not working. Within a few days I also noticed that the monitor would periodically flicker, then go black for about 5-10 seconds, before coming back on. 

I wanted to make sure I had localised the problem properly though, because I'd purchased a lot of new kit with the monitor. So I meticulously tested each component: I purchased a new Apple USB-C cable, for example. When I still didn't work, I purchased an expensive Thunderbolt 3 original Apple cable. I finally made an appointment with Apple, and actually took my Mac desktop in to be tested (it passed all the diagnostic tests).

In this way I checked every possible component - at my own cost, and at significant inconvenience to me - before reporting the problem to Wex. I wrote a detailed account of what I'd done to ensure the problem was with the monitor, not with any other machine or accessory.
 
I then spent nearly 90 minutes carefully packing the monitor and every part that it came with, in each of the individual packaging (BENQ's packaging is very elaborate).  

I did not want to be without a monitor, for the duration which Wex accepted return then sent it for testing/ processing etc, so, in completely good faith, I ordered a *second* monitor of the same model, again from Wex, which not many customers would do, given their negative experience the first time around.

It took a few days for Wex to accept the return. Interestingly, when Wex replied, their customer service rep did not offer a *single word of apology* or even acknowledge all the trouble that their customer had been through -- but who still made a second, very expensive purchase from them.

It's taken about a week, but Wex did finally process my refund for the first order. 

However, I was in for a final bit of a shock. When Wex refunded my order they did not refund the Order that was actually faulty and which was returned (the first one) [Order No. 52494835 (PO9379653608)]. They 'refunded' the second display that I had purchased (and kept).

Why does it matter? Well, I noticed just now that the second order so happened to be at a lower price - I think Wex was retailing it at a lower price when I bought the second monitor (which I kept). 

I really felt this was a very poor way to treat a customer, whom Wex had already caused so much trouble to. Not only was there no apology or acknowledgement at all, not even a word, it looks like they're even stooping to cheat a good customer of the correct refund. A decent business would have not just refunded the customer the correct amount, they would have gone above and beyond to acknowledge the inconvenience, extra costs, lost time with some sort of gesture. This was appallingly poor - like a slap on the face.",,2021-05-21T22:56:52Z,1,Ramachandran,,6
"Long delays for refund, and no response to emails.","I returned 3 items to Wex on 10th May. 2 have been refunded, but I have heard nothing about the third.

Very Disappointed,"Where do I begin is a good question , well here goes ...
I was recommended to deal with Wex Photos through a popular photography website  , people said they were ones to go to for camera equipment , unfortunately this was not my experience .
I ordered a second hand lens from their website , the lens was described in excellent condition , something i will come back to later .
I took up the option of delivery to my local store  and was promptly told when the lens would arrive .
When the day arrived that I was to pick up the lens I phoned the company to make sure it had arrived , I was informed that it was not to be delivered to the store but it was to be delivered to my home address , this was odd as I had stipulated store delivery , thankfully I had took a screen shot showing I had indeed stipulated collection from store .
So the following day I stayed in waiting for the lens to be delivered to my home ....nothing ...the day after I phoned the company asking where the lens was and even more bizarrely where was a tracking number  , I finally got my tracking number from them only to find out that when I putthe number in the couriers search engine , no such tracking number existed ...
I again phoned the company asking what is happening , they blamed their warehouse and the fact that they could not contact them , each person I spoke to assured me they would sort the issue out  and phone me back ...guess what no phone call from any of them ..this went on for another day .
In desperation i made one final call explaining that I found it very hard to believe that they couldn't get in touch with their warehouse , fortunately the man I spoke to finally sorted it out and low and behold it was actually delivered to the store on the original day they had said but had not put it on their system as delivered ...this was unbelievable, totally appalling customer service .
When I opened the box i was bit shocked at the state of the lens , it appeared dirty and un cleaned , indeed i would describe  the barrel having the appearence of some on having dropped a load of shavings on it  and the optics had a few marks which were not put on the websites ""excellent "" description 
To be honest Wex only got the one star as I cant leave no Stars.",,2021-05-20T16:58:12Z,1,B.Dryden,,7
First off,"First off, they don't display how many items are actually in stock. I ordered 5 of an item, only to find out they only had 2 in stock and I needed to ask them to split the order or they will wait for everything in stock before they dispatched. 

So after this trouble come the delivery day, and they delivered an incorrect item! Emailed them no response so tried live chat as getting nervous about this. Was met with rudeness and unwillingness to help, told me to call but I pressed on as why should I go through the hassle when I have been sent the wrong item. So the adviser reluctantly helped. Still not received an update on the collection for the incorrect item so hope they fix this promptly.

All in all a terrible experience.",,2021-05-20T14:57:59Z,1,Yan Tsui,"Manchester, GB",29
Appalling Customer Service and Lousy P/X Value,"Having spent well into 4 figures on two camera systems from WEX ( a Panasonic G9 system and a Fuji X-T3 system ) I remain appalled at their customer service and particularly at the attitude of their customer service manager. He twice promised to look into a dreadful situation in which I was insulted by staff while attempting to make a purchase, to listen to all phonecalls relating, has failed to do so, and has never got back to me. Despite this I tried today to agree a part ex deal. The amount WEX offered, despite that I am a regular customer, was less than rival offers from two other UK based retailers. WEX will have to do far far better if they ever want my business again. What a shame, and what ghastly staff.
I have just read Mark's reply and I assume he is Mark L. the service manager I spoke to. Most of what he has written is, unfortunately, either half true or a blatant lie. The complaints I made were 1/ A lens I purchased in good faith and returned was described as 'mint' when the glass on both sides was filthy, the lens was covered in dust specs, and there was a thumbprint etched on to the rear glass it took me 20 mins to carefully clean off, and 2/ I was offered less for a lens that wex supplied as a freebie with a G9 kit, on a subsequent part ex deal than I was offered in cash by camera jungle. Both valid complaints. And when staff were insulting and rude on the phone, Mark L. promised to listen to the calls. He never got back to me, even though he says in his reply that he investigated. No apology, nothing. I spoke to him and reiterated my complaint. There was no proper apology, and no conversation that took place in any way as he described, below. Mark L. your customer service is APPALLING and a DISGRACE, and if that lens is anything to go by your descriptions of 2nd hand items are LIES. I have just bought a used camera from MPB, an RX10 Mk1 described as mint. It was, too, and I've kept it. 10/10 for them. At least have the decency to offer a proper apology, and TRUTHFUL explanation by private email if you prefer. As a customer service manager, isn't that your job?",,2021-05-20T11:14:38Z,1,Pro Biker,,12

A lack of concern,"I telephoned to purchase a shutter release for a Lumix FZ2000 and was advised to opt for the Hahnel model, although Wex didn't have the Panasonic model available anyway. The instructions with the item were minimal, so I connected it to my camera and the lens immediately zoomed to maximum.  I telephoned Wex for advice and was told to return it for a refund.  As that was hardly a solution I asked to speak to a technical advisor who stating the obvious said ""Oh dear, that shouldn't happen!""  As he too was unable to assist me I tried another lead from the box which worked perfectly.  Because the item is intended for Olympus and Lumix and both leads fit either camera, it's a shame the instructions and Wex staff don't make it clear.",,2021-05-12T12:41:02Z,1,Mr Peter Walker,,8
Disappointing trade in experience,"I traded in a gimbal which ended up being declined due to the tilt axis getting stuck, after it was returned to me I tested it and found no problems at all.

I can only assume that whoever tested the gimbal at Wex either didn't attach a camera onto the gimbal or didn't balance it correctly which will result in the gimbal not working correctly.

Part-Exchange Experience,"For all on-line purchases Wex have been great. Love the guys in the local store who are very helpful. However, the on-line part-exchange process was painful and the returned items were given forensic type examination revealing things I couldn't see with the naked eye. You may think it is pristine, but expect at least a 7% reduction on the original offer price on a camera body. About one year ago I had a completely different experience with their major UK on-line rival and regret not going down that route again.


Amanda, thank you for your reply and your offer of a possible discount on future purchases. However, I feel trust has been eroded and I'm unlikely to be in a position to avail of your offer. 
The reason is that I made a very large step up in my part exchange and made a pre-purchase of a very expensive camera, assuming I would get the full amount in your offer for the two cameras I was part exchanging. I had an identical offer from your major competitor and every reason to believe there would be no quibble from them on the part exchange price, based on my previous experience with them one year ago. I wanted to go with Wex because of the wonderful team you have in your local store that have really won me around to your cause.
So I just wanted to be assured that it was unlikely there would be any reduction to your offer price resulting from an inspection and I called your customer services team. I was told that if the cameras were pristine like I said there would be no reduction. This is where things went wrong. I should have been informed or given some clue as to how rigorous and forensic this examination would be and therefore that I was quite likely to see a reduction - in this case it turned out to be £126 for things I failed to see with my naked eye.
I took this assurance on trust and placed the order for the new camera. I didn't go with with the competing offer purely because had been so impressed with your local support and I'm now regretting this decision.",,2021-03-11T12:11:14Z,1,Colin Paul,,4
Horrible trade in experiance!!,"I thought that Wex was going to be customer oriented however that was not true from my experience. I sold the a7 sIII to them which was about 3 months old at this point, they gave me a price i was not super happy with however since I wanted to pre-order an item (sadly also from Wex) with this money I went along with this. I later found  my camera in their used section for a 900 pound profit, seeing this made me feel both cheated and angry, it just shows that they really do not care about the customer and has taught me you are better off looking somewhere else for a better customer experience.",,2021-03-10T13:20:57Z,1,Ali Murtaza Sheikh,,1

I was trading up 12 months ago and was talked into a Nikon D750. I took everything the salesman said onboard and completed the sale. 12 months on and I decided to upgrade again and naturally turned to Wex only to find out I had been sold a pup. The camera was apparently an import not UK stock, and it had a high shutter count. None of this information had been told me at the time of the sale. I went to Wex's website where it states they do not deal with imports, obviously they do because they sold me one. As to the shutter count, I did not understand this until it came time to part ex.

Later on (nearing 3pm on the Friday) I got a second call from their rental team saying they had an alternative yet couldn't deliver to Whitechapel. The only thing they could do was arrange delivery straight to my home address and lo and behold nothing turned up.
What I don't appreciate the most is essentially being lied to-I emphasised to them on the Friday that if they didn't have the mic that I would cancel the agreement- but obviously they tried to fob me off with promises to prevent me from doing that.

I then asked if I could have the one I returned as there was nothing wrong with it, it was just missing parts. I was then told that that had sold! 

I now am gonna have to wait 6-8 weeks before they have the product back in stock, And then I will need to pay full price Instead of the amount i did pay for the product.

Not impressed,"First of all let me say that until now I have always given Wex 5 stars for their service. Unfortunately not this time. I ordered my item on 17/06/20, 12 days later it was still showing ""awaiting stock"". So I called Wex and spoke to Josh and asked him when would the item be in Stock. He said he would have a word and get back to me, I haven't heard back from him from that day to this. On the 23/07/20 I got an email saying my item was in Stock. So I expected delivery shortly after that. 4 days went by and nothing arrived so I called Wex again. This time I spoke to Terry who then told me that because it was over 28 days I had to re-enter my payment details. Had I not called again I would not have know this and probably still be waiting for my item. I'm afraid the customer service on this occasion was severely lacking. I had to do all the chasing and josh couldn't even call me back as he said he would. Not sure if I will be going back to Wex anymore.

We understood that due to a there being only a limited amount of our requirement being in the UK , that our order would be deliverable in 2 consignments. The second to follow direct from it's manufacturers in Germany. This we accepted, and were referred on to Internal Sales Management and our initial contacts with that department were also good. Part one of our order was delivered promptly and as scheduled. However our subsequent attempts to contact Internal Sales Management, in order to track it's second half, in spite of assurances that they would call us back, proved completely fruitless. Eventually in desperation we contacted the manufacturers UK Office. They very efficiently investigated the issue, and found that the carriers maintained that they had attempted to deliver the 2nd consignment several days previously, and as they there'd been no one to receive it ( patently untrue because there was somebody available here throughout day in question) and that our consignment was already on it's way back to Germany.

Got an order confirmation and went on with my day or filming, only to receive an email 2 hours later saying my order had not been despatched as a fraud prevention measure, despite me using Mastercard SecureCode during payment.

The email also asked for me to email my DOB and either passport number or driving licence to prove who I am - I have no issue doing this but not via email, which is not secure.

Called to complain and prove who I was and was told my identity had been cleared but that it now would not be available for Next Day delivery, which is what I needed.

I am really annoyed that Wex didn't try calling me or apply some common sense to their Fraud Protection system. I get that companies need to protect against fraudulent practices, but not when I have used MasterCard SecureCode. As a result, I don't have the equipment I needed urgently.

I feel very let down by Wex. If you need to be sure of your delivery, don't rely on their order confirmations and keep an eagle eye on your emails in case you are deemed to be a fraud risk.

Local business disappoints on delivery.,"Ordered photo printer on the Sunday 17th for birthday of wife on 24th, promised next day delivery. In the light of the pandemic I indicated delivery on Thursday would be OK. As the store is in Norwich and I live 20 miles away, I saw this as a no-brainer. I could even collect it if there were any problems. Wex did not put it in the post immediately on Monday. I had a tracking number which showed it did not get to the depot until Thursday and then was not delivered until Tuesday 26th because of Bank holiday Monday.
Very disappointed. Chose Wex to support a local business over rivals. As my wife and I are elderly we do not have many birthday presents and particularly during the virus, so her present from me was really important as we could not celebrate with family or dine out.

On receipt, I coupled the lens to my D2X only to discover that the Auto Focus SWM was making horrible dry high pitched squealing & grinding noises.

The noise would of been embarrassing if used in a wildlife hide or similar setting.

Aftersales we’re slow to respond and despite asking to speak to someone, correspondence was made over Facebook messenger and email only.

The lens should have never been posted-out without being checked. 

I have asked for a like for like replacement or my money back

Disappointed as this is the 4th 300mm lens that I have tried to purchase but received sub standard equipment which doesn’t match their lens grade.

To much money involved to let it ride and accept.

If I could rate lower than 1 star I would.,"If I could rate lower than 1 star I would. Traded in a Sigma lens only to find out the price quoted was for store credit and not cash. No mention of this in the email but you can find this in the small print, on a separate page, on a drop down menu...

Fair enough, I make a phone call to clarify this I was told I would be called back that day by a manager, no-one calls. I then call up the next morning and speak to a different adviser who says they will need to speak to a manager and they will call me back by 3pm. Again, no-one calls. I call a third time and a different adviser tells me there is no manager available to speak to me, I say I will wait and hold for a few minutes. The adviser comes back (not the manager) and says the manager can't offer the cash price. That's ok I say, send the lens back to me an I will sell it elsewhere (MPB, very quick and easy, highly recommended).

After a couple of days my lens has not been returned, fed up of having to take the time to call them I use the online chat function. The adviser on there is confused and largely unhelpful, but sends an email to one of his colleagues in the returns department. This colleague emails me and says they have no record of anything being sent back to me. I email a response stating I was disappointed at their failure to communicate, an item should be returned as was discussed verbally. several hours later I receive an email from a manager with a brief apology and that the item would be dispatched that day.

One final act of incompetence, they didn't bother to confirm where the item was to be sent and it went to my home address, and not the address I originally had the item collected from. Fortunately a neighbour saw the delivery driver leaving and was able to take the parcel for me.

I don't normally write reviews, but the experience was so disappointing that I feel this is justified. Perhaps this was a one off incident, but the total lack of communication between 5-6 colleagues and managers suggests otherwise.

Edit: Since I am not able to reply to the below response.

Yifa - Thank you for taking the time to respond. If you had read my review properly you would see that I did not dispute that the item had eventually been returned, I did state that a neighbour took it in for me. so you confirming this is irrelevant.

*reply to Wex
Thank you Mark, the order was originally placed for a photography job on the 13th January and Saturday delivery organised. The item arrived faulty and I had to do the job without it. I’m sorry but i don’t buy ‘we sent emails’ as if you had sent it and it had been returned you would have been notified or it would have been in my junk. Your sales and promotional emails manage to come through to the same address ok?! 

 Wex you purchased calumet a pro photography dealer a few years ago  - you cannot apply consumer t&cs to pro accounts. You must either have a ‘pro’ division of Wex or continue to run calumet as a separate company. Pro photographers rely on suppliers and have often pressure jobs and clients to respond to if things go wrong. 

The collection of my parcel didn’t happen yesterday (27.1.2020) I have a lock up container within my studio and I must have been in there when the delivery driver arrived. I found the ‘unable to collect your parcel’ on my desk next to the parcel that needed collecting! 

I have arrange another collection attempt - but If it isn’t collected today I’ll write it off and you can keep the money and spend it on your staff. Spending more and more of my time trying to return your faulty item isn’t worth it. I think 1 star and ‘terrible I’m afraid’ is appropriate. 

For context to any reader:  To date I have made three phone calls, written three emails, applied online for another collection attempt and written the two reviews here in an effort to return one faulty item to Wex and have them refund my money.",,2020-01-28T20:17:35Z,1,"Matt, Kent ",,2

Camera did not arrive and Wex messed up their refund.,"Camera (OB packaging opened camera body) did not arrive. Wex chosen courier advised my expensive Wex parcel was out for delivery Friday 3rd Jan 2020 for delivery approx 1pm. It didn't arrive after I waited in all day. Same thing happened Monday 6th Jan - out for delivery and not received. And, after courier advised it was out for delivery for the third time on Tuesday 7th January, despite me phoning Wex twice to get them to intervene, it was taken back to the depot again arriving 1611 hours. Suspecting the parcel was lost I phoned Wex who agreed to cancel the order, and I waited on the phone while they got approval from a manager and put through a refund. Wex told me to leave everything to them, my money was refunded and they would take it from here. On 14th January I had to phone Wex again because the refund had not been received and the charge appeared on my monthly credit card statement. Wex checked and confirmed that someone at Wex had cancelled the refund for no reason they could explain. After checking with my Bank I now have to pay for a camera body I have not received to avoid interest charges and wait until a credit balance works off in a months time.  So have I actually had to pay real money to my credit card company to protect Wex against the possibility that they wouldn't get the camera body back from their own chosen courier, despite them being able to see it wasn't delivered. The refund was finally received 24 hours after Wex reported it was received back and re-advertised it for sale. This should be Wex's risk - not the customer's. So how could I give Wex more than 1 Star?",,2020-01-16T11:45:04Z,1,Chris Saywood,,43

Let down again.,I have just had an unfortunate exchange with WEX where they appear unable or unwilling to accept responsibility for the delivery of items purchased from them. Today is the third time in as many months that my goods have not arrived next day. I paid for this service which they offer but seem unable to deliver. I have no control over their choice of courier and a previous promise to send my goods with someone other than Parcelforce seems to have been forgotten. Sooner or later they will realise that delivery is an important part of the mail order process. In reply to the delivery stats they have quoted to me my experience has been 100 per cent failure.,,2020-01-08T13:30:52Z,1,Cecil Greer,,11

Taking into account that I do not wish to drive shops off the streets I made the trip to the Wex shop in Norwich to buy a Vanguard tripod I arrived and found the tripod price listed at £164 I had seen the said tripod on the Wex web site listed at £149.00 I did question the price and was told that they must have missed that change in the price. Although the web site price was honoured and I bought the tripod for £149 it still left me feeling uneasy if I hadn't done my homework I would been £15 worse off.",,2019-12-17T12:19:42Z,1,Ivan Briggs,,22

Received used item,"I bought many cameras, lenses and other accessories over the years from Wex shop and few things online. Without hesitate i ordered my new monitor from them a week ago. They had two options available while I was shopping - brand new monitor and a cheaper used one (opened box with limited warranty). I ordered the new one, as I preferred full warranty. What was my surprise when I discovered that my brand new monitor has a double security seal on the box and the one below is cut. The box was also slightly damaged, despite sitting in a bigger outer box wrapped in air pillows. It's worth to mention that Fedex courier refused to bring the parcel to my door at 4 floor (lift was available) and left it at the building's entrance door.

I contacted customer service straight away and arranged return and replacement. Monitor already returned, but I am still waiting for the dispatch of the new one (it was supposed to arrive today).

I want to believe that the whole thing was someone's mistake, unfortunately I lost my trust to Wex Photo Video.

DONT PART EXCHANGE - READ THIS LETTER OF COMPLAINT,"Wex,
I am writing this e-mail as an official complaint and expressing my disgust at what appears to be a scam in your Part Exchange or (We Buy Used Equipment) scheme and at the manner in which the incident was dealt with by the manager of this team.
Before I go into the nature of the complaint I will make it clear that this is a matter of principle and has nothing to do with the valuation of any of the items.
12 items (all in near mint condition) have been sent in to Wex in order to convert into cash as per quote.
The complaint is regarding one item in particular a Nikon 10-24mm f3.5-4.5 G AF-S DX Lens. This lens was purchased from Wex (used) on the 23/11/18, an unused Christmas present that has remained in a Peli Case for 12 months without any use at all. This item was flagged by the PartEx team as (Faulty) and it was then brought to my attention that Wex indent for it to be sent off for repair at my expense.
If this lens is faulty upon inspection this week – it’s a certainty that it was sold to me faulty on 23/11/18 as the lens had never been used. After the PartEx team realized this in fact was a lens they sold to me and is registered as a purchase on my account – they maintained the lens would never have been sold faulty and therefore for them offer the quoted amount it would be sent for repair at my expense. They also confirmed that the lens is no longer covered by the one year warranty.
This annoyed me beyond words and therefore I asked what exactly is the fault found – they replied the Auto/Manual focus switch is slightly stiff.
This particular item aside for a moment – two other expensive items also had apparent phantom faults for example a d810 with CF card ejector pin that works as normal may fail in the future.
Also a 24-70 with a focus ring that’s not as smooth to turn as one would expect.

•            I have now decided that I will not be trading in any of the items to Wex and am requesting that they all be sent back immediately with all the included accessories. This is with the exception of the Nikon 10-24mm f3.5-4.5 G AF-S DX Lens.

•            I am requesting a full refund of £346.35 for the Nikon 10-24mm f3.5-4.5 G AF-S DX Lens.

As this item has been sold to me faulty by your own admission. Failure to refund this item in full will result in the matter being dealt with by Trading Standards.
Regardless of my utter disgust at deliberate attempts to obtain items below the quoted value – it has been a massive waist of my time carefully packaging these items and sending them in to an outfit that’s informed me that three items are in need of repair at my expense, when they are not even valid faults and one of the items was sold by you in its current condition one year ago. 
I have used your company from its beginning and was a satisfied customer until this incident.  You have now lost a loyal customer who will never return. Furthermore – I will update your Trust Pilot rating with a copy of this e-mail, I have also noticed via Trust Pilot that I am not the only one who has experienced this with the PartEx team.
You will of course only lose one customer here – however word of mouth is very powerful and I assure you that this experience will be shared online and with people I know. Over time these experiences will gain momentum and eventually catch up with you damaging your reputation.",,2019-12-06T10:14:54Z,1,Kieron,,2

Trade-in policy suspect,"I have now sent a number of items to Wex for trade-in. They seem to have a policy of offering a good value to get your business; but once you send in the item for appraisal, they find reasons to significantly reduce the price. I just sent a Sony FE mount lens which I had bought from them about a year ago. It had hardly been used and was in very good condition with the original box and everything you would get with a brand new lens. As usual they ring you up once the item has been ""inspected"" and say there is some small cosmetic problem and offer a much reduced value.

As this is at least the fourth time it has happened to me, it seems to be a business policy. I will not be using them again for either trade - in or straight purchase.",,2019-12-03T21:23:54Z,1,Michael Dowling,,5

Overpriced repair at wex trade-in.,"I sent my canon 24-70 L lens to Wex trade-in after receiving a competitive online quote. After inspection of the lens I was informed it had a fault and I agreed to have it sent to Fixation for an estimate. I only had the lens serviced by Fixation less than 6 months earlier and had barely used it since, so I hoped it would be repaired under warranty. Instead, after waiting 2 weeks I got an estimate of £408. As I have had poor service from Fixation in the past, I asked repeatedly for my lens back - which took almost 2 weeks! I then took it to a reputable local repairer who did an excellent and professional repair for only £108. I will be trading in my gear elsewhere in future as this experience was poor on all levels.",,2019-12-02T10:08:41Z,1,Cocodog,,2

They told me that the delivery drivers gos was 9 minutes from my address (9 minutes by car? On foot? Either way that's some distance) and refunded my delivery cost. GREAT! I'll replace the camera with the 4.99 shall I 😂. 

Granted I understand it may not be directly there fault, but surely they should be making more of an effort to assist me in either actually getting the camera (which is obviously the preferred result), providing me with a replacement, or refunding me the price of the order. Yes, this may be a problem with parcelforce, however assistance should be made from the seller, rather than just passing me off to someone else.",,2019-11-07T13:02:21Z,1,kobe long,,3

I would have liked to have awarded 5…,"I would have liked to have awarded 5 Stars, because I received first class service, just recently, when I purchased 3 used Canon camcorder batteries from you, which were delivered the next day.

However, following on from that, I contacted your technical department, and spoke to a female member of staff, to ask about the Zhiyun Crane 3.  I wanted to know if my Canon XA20 (which I purchased from you, a few years ago), would fit on to this gimbal. 

I asked her if it would be possible, for her to find out if it would be  physically possible by trying this out in your store.  I left her my telephone contact number and she said that she will find out and get back to me.  I told her that if the canon camcorder would fit the Crane 3, then I would purchase this gimbal from you.at £ 649.

I waited in all day that day, and she did not phone me back, which made me think that perhaps she and her colleagues, decided that my camcorder would not fit, because this gimbal is not designed to accommodate the conventional camcorder.  The Crane 3 is designed for DSLR cameras, which I am aware of.

I did some more research and discovered, looking at videos on YouTube, that according to their promotional video, the newly released Zhiyun Weebill S can accommodate compact cinema cameras.

So, because no one return their call to me from Wex, I decided to purchase the Zhiyun Weebill S, which is exactly the same price of £369, from Amazon.

I hate it when someone promises me that they will get back and they don't, which is very unusual for Wex.  

I provided and repeated clearly my land line telephone number to your member of staff - and she couldn't be bothered to get back to me :(

I am pleased to inform you that my Canon XA20 - fits like a glove, on my new Zhiyun Weebill S, and I have tested it, and it works fine!

It is very likely that the Canon XA20 will also fit on the Zhiyun Crane 3, then I would have purchased that from you instead.

Yes, yes  of course - these gimbals are meant for DSLR, as it says in Zhiyun compatibility list - but I asked your member of staff, if she could find out if my canon would physically fit on the Crane 3.

So - this being the reason for just one star; I waited and waited for her return call, which ended up being a waste of time!

Ordered some equipment to come on a Saturday which I was told the order would arrive. Waited in all day nothing came as the items were not in stock. As they had no idea when the items would be in stock I had to contact the manufacturer as to when the items would be in stock. I was told it would be at least 10 weeks before there would be any in the country, let alone distributed. 
CHAPTER 4
I decided to give them one last try at getting things right I ordered some items on the internet which were supposed to be in stock. I received an e-mail stating that one of the items was out of stock. I telephoned them to find out when they would be delivered as they were on a next day delivery. I was asked by the member of staff if I would like the items in stock to be sent. As all the items were to be used together I told the member of staff that I would like them all to be delivered together. Yet two days later the items in stock were sent without those out of stock. The other items when in stock would be sent (hopefully after three weeks).
This is a company that ignores the wishes of the customer, does its own thing regardless and after this experience I will be trying to find another company when it comes to upgrading my camera equipment.

Mis-sold a product and ignored by Customer Services management team,"I like WEX and have bought multiple products from them before, both pre-used and new. In September 2019, I purchased a used Kirk BH-1 ball-head that was rated as fully functional. When I received it, it wasn't functional at all. I returned it and was kindly offered a £30 discount off a more expensive used Kirk BH-1 ballhead in stock, which I accepted. When this product arrived, I discovered it weighed less than the original and was a different size. It was a Kirk BH-3 ballhead branded by WEX as a BH-1. When I enquired about this, I was given the offer again to return it and offered a further discount (£10 off any future spend, because I'd already been given £30 off). I queried whether £10 was a final offer and asked for confirmation if WEX were complying with the Consumer Rights Act 2015. That was three weeks ago and despite following up (and receiving a holding note from a colleague), I've yet to receive any response from the management team to my questions. I'll continue to shop in store (the Edinburgh office is great) but I've lost all trust in Wex online sales.

Customer service was great as they fully refunded us for the order so we could pay our paid staff for the unnecessary waiting time but I will probably place my order with someone else purely because of their delivery times.",,2019-09-20T19:42:51Z,1,Rajeshwaren ,,2
Wrongly advertised lens and poor delivery service,"Bought a used Nikon f4.5-5.6 AF-P lens for £374, great price as was advertised 9+ condition.

"Misleading stock, poor customer service, AVOID!","Misleading stock, poor customer service, avoid!
A week ago I contacted Wex Photo Video, asking whether they had six packs of film in stock. I was told ""yes, we do."" The next morning I went online, put six packs in my basket, and it displayed ""in stock"" throughout the process. This is MISLEADING! In fact, ""in stock"" means ""at least one"" not, as is the case on virtually every other website, ""enough in stock for your order.""
I phoned them up pretty much immediately after getting a ""your item is not in stock"" email. I was told to leave it with them, and they would sort it out. This was on a Friday.
On Saturday, i was told ""we haven't heard back from our supplier and they're closed for the weekend; wait until Monday."" On Monday, I was told ""we haven't got ahold of them,"" ""can you get stock in from your stores?"" ""Yes, we'll look into it."" On Tuesday, I was told their stores would send it out to them, and that it was certain to reach me by Thursday before I headed off traveling.
Now, on Wednesday, I've just been told that ""there's no guarantee"" that it'll make it to me before I go traveling. I now don't have enough time to order it from someone else, and there's little chance it'll reach me on time. 
While I still hold out hope, this should not be the case: a customer should not be ""hoping"" that their order makes it to them on time, or that the stores did indeed send it today. I have felt neglected, palmed off, and ignored at every step of this process. At one point, after waiting three hours for an ""I'll email you right away"" email, I phoned up and was told ""how funny, I was just about to email you.""
Time may work slower for some people, but it is just not viable and is, frankly, unacceptable in a professional environment.",,2019-09-04T18:21:25Z,1,Benedict Winchester,,9

I packed it up very carefully and sent to them.  I received a call a few days later saying the camera was covered in a sticky residue and not as good as I had said and that the lens was damaged.  I queried this as the camera was perfectly clean when I sent it to them and the lens was unused.  Nobody would send them a camera covered in a sticky residue after all.  Anyway they said they would only pay £76 now for the camera and nothing for the lens and that they would only give me credit which was not part of the original agreement.

Untested Used Lens ! :-(,"Having used WEX many times before for new and used equipment I trusted the company and never had any doubts about them. . . . 
But I just purchased a used Canon EOS 7D and 100-400mm L series Lens from them specifically to photograph the Royal International Aircraft Tattoo this week (an event I have been planning a visit to all year). This purchase turned up last saturday as expected, but I did not have time to fully test said products, and also felt that a company of their standard would have thoroughly checked these products them selves. 
Day one and the Lens would not focus at 400mm (kind of an issue in aviation photography !) I then resorted to trying Manual Focus only to find that once switched over the focus ring would stay locked as if set in AF.
On day two of the airshow the Lens gave up completely. No auto focus at all throughout the whole range of the lens.
I tested the lens on other photographers cameras and the same faults showed, to say I was angry is a vast understatement. This event was a big deal to me and I had taken a loan out to be able to afford a Pro Quality lens, and the 3 days in total have cost me over £300 in tickets and hotel stays for an event that is irrelevant to me without a working camera. I have yet to contact WEX, as I have only just got back from RIAT. But I sincerely hope they can change my current opinion of themselves as I am massively out of pocket and have missed the only decent Airshow in the UK that only happens once a year.",,2019-07-19T20:40:51Z,1,Michael Farmer,,5

Wasted Journey and money.,"I visited the store in Norwich and made a £750 cash purchase. The journey took me 1.5 hours to get there and 2.5 to get home. The item which I had purchased didn't work as it should so I phoned the store and said I would like to return the item and have a full refund in cash. The young chap on the phone said this will not be a problem and I asked him will there be enough money in the till to refund me in full as the day of travel will be a Sunday and I don't want to waste my time or fuel on a wasted journey when I can post the item back to you. The reply was Yes there will be enough money in store you you to receive a full refund. Again the journey was an hour plus and when I got to the store I was told ""you will have a credit note or put onto a bank card because we only have £100 in the till. You can totally imagine how disappointed and fuming I was but that I kept my cool and stayed calm and had no other choice than to have the money put on a bank card.

Poor show all around really.,"On this sale in question I spent about £4.5k on a new Nikon Z6 and Z7.  I was advised by the sales department that they did not have any Z7 with Mount Adapter FTZ in stock and it would be a 3 week wait. I went ahead and purchased the Z7 anyway because we needed it for a project. However 30 minutes later on the website it said that the Z7 pack with mount adapter was in stock. After I rang to complain they said my Z7 was already in the post. 

I asked them to honor the £100 difference for the mount adapter (£269 new) but they refused. They asked me to send the Z7 back for a return on the proviso that if the item was lost or damaged in the post I would be responsible for it. I didnt want to take that risk because shipping is notoriously poor at the moment. 

I gave up and bought the adapter elsewhere at the retail price. I doubt I will be honoring my future loyalties with Wex - especially as the equipment was cheaper at a non-specialist global online retailer.

Trade-in and the fiasco that followed,"I've just bought another camera. But the reason for this review is because it's a year on from the last one I bought, and this time it wasn't from WEX. The problem I have is their attitude to customers, not with the goods.

My poor experience is not with the camera I bought from them (2018), but from the trade-in process, and how once we agreed that they would send my equipment back, a merry-go-round of empty promises and inaccurate information was all I got.

The story is too long to post here, but after innumerable phone calls and emails, I used the 'complaints' (form I think) on their website to tell them that I thought that the service was very poor. Guess what? They never even had the courtesy to acknowledge or reply...

Wex personnel have been very good in dealing with this, but as yet I still do not have an acceptable product. I think the manufacturers quality control leaves a lot to be desired",,2019-03-08T09:59:31Z,1,Mr C. Frith,,17
Tel order to Wex for Atomos Shinobi,"Tel order to Wex for Atomos Shinobi.  Little product knowledge.  No advice on accessories.
Product arrived OK, but unusable - no battery, no leads, no hot shoe mount.
Phoned Wex Bristol to order accessories for collection in store.  Better product knowledge.  Grateful to Hannah.  One adapter item not available, so ordered and booked for Parcel Force delivery to home address.
Parcel Force unable to deliver (inadequate address details).  No attempt by Parcel Force to contact me, waiting by the phone.  Hopefully redelivery to local post office by Wednesday.
What a saga of cock-ups.

Bad experience with WEX,"I returned a camera to them unused and they would not give me my money back, the camera had a stained/dirty sensor and they tried to charge me £290 for a sensor clean! In the end I had to pay half of that and traded the camera at a loss of over £300, not a very reassuring experience. Even then they refused to give me my refund as cash but as a credit note, I have now spent this and am now considering not using WEX again. It was more like two months and really that is not the point, the point is, I bought the goods in good faith and returned them in good faith. However that faith on my part seems to have been misplaced and the bond of trust between Business and Customer has now been broken.
I'm the one that is down to the tune of £300 quid not WEX who cannot consider the fact that there was a Fuji X-H1 shaped hole in the WEX net and this one slipped thru, whatever happened to ""The customer is always right""?",,2019-02-12T11:01:25Z,1,julian walley,,12

Completely Disappointing,"To be fair, this was my third purchase from WEX and the first two were perfectly fine.
- Made my purchase online on a Saturday and delivery was promised in 4 working days; Thursday of the following week.
- On Tuesday while at work I had a text from WEX's courier service PARCEL FORCE to say they had attempted to deliver the camera, and left a card. Got home after work, no card. Tried to ring PF, it was after 6pm. Recorded message.
- Checked the tracker to see that delivery was attempted again on Wednesday and camera returned to Depot. Rang PF and scheduled delivery for Thursday.
- Arranged to work from home n Thursday to take delivery of the camera, no delivery up till 5pm. Back on the phone and learn that parcel did not go out for delivery. Request Saturday delivery and I am told there will be £9 charge. After protests, promised to waive charge and deliver camera between 7am and 1pm on Saturday. 
- Saturday came, 10am; from tracker cannot see that package is out for delivery. Rang Customer Services at WEX and request that they push PF to make the delivery that day. I was promised that they would ring PF and ensure the delivery is made before 1pm (PF cut-off time) on Saturday. No delivery was made.
- I ring back to learn that delivery is now scheduled for Monday. Completely frustrated and furious, I cancel the order. No confirmation received from WEX.
Monday morning I telephone WEX again to request an email confirming that the order was cancelled and requesting my refund. The email is sent immediately. The refund, I am told, cannot be initiated until the camera (that I never received) is returned to WEX. I ask to speak to a senior person and I am transferred. That does no good, as this person too insists that they must have the camera back before they make the refund. Apparently, PF could attempt delivery again and I might accept the camera. Or someone else at home might take delivery of the camera. If there was someone else at home to take delivery in the first place, we would not be having this problem, I try to explain. They are having none of it. So, until PF updates their system to show that the camera has been returned to the sender, no refund for me who never even received it.
Poor, poor customer service from WEX. Never again.",,2018-10-09T15:09:55Z,1,Adrian Simon,,2
"UPDATE:  SHOCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE..Used them for 12 years, but NO MORE.","I purchased a camera that came with a hotshoe cover missing. I was advised to go and try and source one myself from Amazon because ""Unfortunately we don't have and can't source one for you"".....
 
Here is just a quick quote from their webpage - 

'We want our customers to feel confident about every purchase they make with us. Whether it's a brand-new camera, or an item from our 'Pre-Loved' second-hand range.

We treat all our customers with the care and attention that is expected from the UK's biggest photo retailer.

We live by these promises.'

The lack of customer service aside, you would have thought that the ""UK's biggest photo retailer"" might have enough knowledge of the industry and hopefully common sense to source one, because they are indeed available on Amazon..... but why should I have to source a missing part.

I have put an AWESOME amount of money through their books since 2005 when they were Warehouse Express and this is the Customer Service I get......SHOCKING! - They have lost me as a customer.

REPLY:
Thanks for the reply, but it means nothing...you are completely missing the point. NO, you can't get one from your suppliers, and YES, I can buy one from Amazon, BUT SO CAN YOU !... I'm pretty sure someone there has an Amazon account and can get a petty cash refund for £7.50. If I had of known 12 years ago that by putting thousands of pounds through your books would have resulted in this level of UN-loyal customer service, I would have taken my business elsewhere. 

Please pass this onto your MD so that the board can get an understanding of what happens when the customer service team has to try and think outside the box and fail to keep a loyal customer happy, when the problem was only ever you NOT supplying what I had ordered.",,2018-10-04T16:07:58Z,1,Ian,,11

BEWARE of WEX part exchange SCAM,"I am a Professional Photographer and was after buying a Nikon SD-9 High Performance Battery Pack for my SB-910 Flash after a search on the WWW I found one at WEX.CO.UK at £199.99 and read that they took equipment in part exchange against items bought online so I contacted WEX put the description of a Nikon SB-600 Flash as MINT (and it was) they offered me £70 in part exchange I was happy with that and they sent me a postage label to send it to them.

I sent the SB-600 to partex-wex.co.uk and got this response: 
Thank you for your request for a quote for your used equipment. Please find our offer below which is based on the information you provided.
Quote Reference: 	50178691
Quote Value: 	£70
This quote will be valid for 28 days.
The price quoted is based on the descriptions and accessories provided by you, and are subject to change after inspection.

After they received the Nikon SB-600 they sent me an email reducing the price :
Thank you for your feedback, I'm sorry we couldn't help you more on this occasion. Unfortunately when a flash gun has corrosion in the battery compartment, there's no way it can be listed as mint. 

In light of this we felt that a £10 deduction was fair, but since you felt differently then we will return the item back to you free of charge. Hopefully you can understand this decision more when you see it for yourself, but if there's anything else I can help you with be sure to ask.

As I have said I am a Professional Photographer and always looked after my Equipment and have it checked regularly as it is My Living.

To finish 
I took Photographs of the SB-600 Flash unit before I sent it to WEX and I know the battery compartments did NOT have corrosion in it and the reason I am writing this review is so that nobody else gets Ripped off by WEX on their part exchange scheme I have the Photographs to PROVE that there was NO corrosion in the battery compartment and even sent them to partex-wex.co.uk where they asked if I wanted to send the flash back for further examination (I didn’t).
Update :
I put the SB-600 flash on Gumtree for £80 and sold it 3 Days later.

Poor communication,"I placed an order for a camera bag, which was awaiting stock but the expected delivery date was 3-7 days. My order didn't come within 7 days.

The person on the other end of the phone kept saying they would chase it up with purchasing but no one ever got back to me. 

Whilst I understand that a retailer can't always control the delivery date from the supplier, I found the lack of communication really poor. I ended up cancelling and ordering from someone who had it in stock.

What made matters worse was that I kept getting emails from Wex. I would open the email to see if it was an update on my order but every time it was just another marketing email. I didn't opt out of marketing emails when I placed the order because I don't mind getting the odd marketing email, particularly with special offers.

Have you ever heard anything like it??? 
Never ever in my life has any retailer at any time for no matter how much money ever asked me that. 
If you are ever asked, NEVER pass any such documents to ANYONE!! This information is the crown jewels to identity thieves and organisations such as  WEX have NO sure fire way of protecting your information from hackers no matter what they say.
Remember, if Hackers can get into the US Military web sites they can sure as hell get into whatever WEX Photo Video have set up!! More to the point, what a bloody cheek!!! they are NOT doing me a favour!! Who do they think they are???
I phoned WEX and told them what I thought of their demands and in turn was regaled with a complete load of rubbish about security etc etc,that had no possible truth, bearing in mind I had paid via PayPal which is very secure and protected.
As it happens I went to Castle Cameras  and got a better lens for £100 cheaper!!! So Wex, your loss is my gain!!!
I hope your saw the rubbish below, I did phone them and no  explanation was acceptable. I note that Wex are insinuating that the order was not genuine which is nothing short of slander, so my advice to you is be very careful about what you insinuate!!!
Lastly, I confirmed with PayPal that there was NO issue with the order and that protection works both ways and it was Wex that was at fault if there was an issue because my PayPal account is absolutely fine!!!
Please NOTE!! the rubbish reply from WEX, No we the public do not like to hand over personal details to a mob like you to no doubt lose or sell to the highest bidder!! All this just to buy a lens I bought much cheaper else where with NO hassle!!",,2018-01-03T12:20:18Z,1,Kashaya,,54
Rental department almost ruined our shoot,"Everything that could go wrong went wrong.

Pros: the kit worked
Cons: we couldn't get confirmation of our reservation until the morning of the shoot, we had to find £8,000 for a deposit to be paid in full (surely a card authorisation would have been enough?), we spent hours on the phone, on hold trying to find where our gear was. Eventually it showed up at our studio an hour and a half late (for a one day shoot, not a good look). Wex sent an Addison Lee van to pick up the gear at the end of the day (also late), the driver had no idea what he was supposed to be picking up, which didn't inspire much confidence that it would be correctly checked back in by Wex. Finally, weeks later I still hadn't been refunded the deposit, and heard nothing from Wex about this until I checked my credit card statement. This took two more phone calls to sort out.

I bought a Sony a6500 from WEX today,"I bought a Sony a6500 from WEX today. As I wanted to pay by Amex I rang the sales line (you can't use Amex on the web site), although I had checked the specs and price on the website. On the website there were a number of items that were reduced if you were to buy them with the camera. One item was spare batteries by Ansmann, with £4 off if you bought them with the camera. Fine. I said to the chap on the phone that I would have two of them (Sony batteries are small and the a6500 gets through them very quickly). All well and good.

I got an email confirming my order, but when I looked the discount had only been applied to one of the batteries. I rang customer service and was told that I should have known this. Exactly how was I supposed to have known this if it wasn't pointed out by the sales person and didn't say so on the website?

I thought that a reputable retailer would make things like this clear (as in transparent, obvious and unambiguous - get the message). OK. It's only £4, but I feel I have been charged when it was likely that I couldn't have been expected to know that you can only get that discount on one item.

There are other retailers out there offering the same prices. Next time I will use one of those as WEX has gone down in my estimation.",,2017-11-14T20:21:55Z,1,John Maw,,24

Don't expect too much!,"Disappointed. Having used this company before and very pleased with customer service decided to use again, that was my mistake. Purchased second user tripod at fair price that was delivered without QR plate. When I contacted company I was informed that I could purchase one as description did not state there was one with the product.( neither did it not!)

I had used WEX before for a straight …,"I had used WEX before for a straight purchase and they were fine. This time I wanted to trade-in – and I thought their approach was distinctly questionable. They gave an value on a Canon 100-400  lens of £560. I sent it – and they phoned to say they thought it wasn’t right and would need to send it to Canon (they were specific) to get a cost. They came back later and said it was £400 to repair. Turned out they didn’t sent it to Canon at all - they sent it to Fixation – which is part of the WEX    group!! Hardly independent.   Indeed quite the opposite. I asked for it back – and it took weeks and weeks to get it back.   Inefficient in a big way.  What is interesting is that I had had the lens given a complete service 6 months earlier and had never used it since. With a Canon authorised company. And no problems were reported. And now I have it back still no apparent  problems – and they won’t let me see the Fixation report. I don’t trust them at all on the part-exchange side.  Looked to me like a fairly blatant attempt to get the price down without independent reason. For a straight purchase they are probably fine  – but be very careful with them on buy-backs. I will never use them again for anything. I bought over £4,000 of new camera stuff from John Lewis instead, such was my disillusionment.",,2017-10-06T16:18:04Z,1,Ted Black,,12

So who loses out customer and a customers client because 2 companies fail to act, in the past have had good service from Wex but this one will be my last plenty of other companies to choose from.",,2017-09-23T19:02:23Z,1,Clive Liddiard,,2
Very poor customer service,"Until recently I have always used Wex and never had a bad word for them, I have spent thousands of pounds with them over the years and always had a great service until now, I have just purchased over £11,560 of goods in the last few days with them but this will be my last time.

 I found that their customer services seem to have went downhill and I have sent them a email cancelling my account, I will buy elsewhere in the future.

 "" Their staff just don't seem to be interested in keeping loyal well paying customers anymore "". Their staff could do with training in how to resolve customers issues and product knowledge.

 I have in the past recommended many of my clients to them, Hand on heart I can no longer recommend Wex for their very poor service. I also advise you to read the rest of the reviews on their facebook page before you purchase.

 The last customer service person that I spoke to seemed only interested that it was near his finishing time and did not call me back the next day. Get a grip Wex with your customer services or you are going to loose a lot more customers.

This Is a copy of the review that I posted on their facebook page.
I will review this again if they decide to contact me again.

Update: Problem Resolved,

I telephoned Wex on Saturday about another order and spoke to a far more helpful customer services agent, I also discussed my previous problem with him.

This chap also resolved my outstanding problem within minutes of me talking to him and restored some of my faith back in Wex, he also arranged to deliver my order on a Sunday in a bank holiday weekend, he can teach the other customer services agents a thing or two about customer relations.

Sorry that I don’t remember your name Sir, again thank you for your excellent service.

Second update,
Items arrived on Sunday less than 24 hours after my telephone conversion, now that’s what I call customer service.

You have certainly redeemed Wex  customer services, well done and thank you again Sir.",,2017-08-26T08:23:23Z,1,Brian,,7

The only other thing to happen is that the delivery charge has been refunded ad I've been asked automatically to comment on service. It would have been free delivery if I hadn't wanted it before Christmas. 

Yeah, it's a courier problem, but actually it's a confidence problem. When WEX say they'll deliver on x day, will they? If it is critical, don't put your faith in their delivery promises.",,2016-12-30T00:22:44Z,1,JD Customer,,6
Disappointing considering my first impressions of the company,"What can I say about Wex Photographic, it was my go to place. 

In 2016 I have spent a good 2.5/3k with the company. Never had an issues, but I guess that is the point, with no issues you dont really rely on any customer service. 5 Star reviews for getting your products to your customers is hardly an achievement, the courier does most of the work.

You order your product, it arrives and all is good. It's when things dont go to plan that you really get the measure of the company and expect a good amount of customer service. This isn't the case for Wex Photographic, I feel completely let down by the company and although I did finally get my issue resolved without it costing me, it was a difficult road and very stressful. I felt like Wex just didnt want to know!

I brought a Metabones Speedbooster from them in June, which failed on me in Sept/Oct causing damage to its pins and damaging my brand new sigma lens also purchased from Wex. 

First off Stuart on the phone said - Yes we will replace the lenses for you. Then I later got a call to tell me they would not and he later said the Metabones Speedbooster was not compatible with the GH4 I was using and I was also told that the Speedbooster was not compatible with APS-C format lenses. (These lenses were less than 1 week old, and I was told that they would not replace them? I felt like I was being robbed) It seemed they were trying to push the blame back onto me to avoid paying for anything, saying that none of the repairs are likely to be covered.

I looked on their website after being told by Stuart after he'd done some research that the metabones was not compatible with my camera (GH4)...

I also called and spoke to someone at Wex prior to purchasing the adapter and I'm pretty sure they said it would be compatible, anyway this is what I found on their own website for the adapter! (I use a panasonic GH4)

Copied from your website:
“Compatible with all MFT mount cameras, including GH4, OM-D, Blackmagic Cinema Camera, Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera and JVC GY-LS300”

“The Speed Booster ULTRA m43 will also work extremely well with many DX and APS-C format lenses provided the image circle of the lens is large enough”

To check this further I email both manufactures (Sigma/Metabones) to check compatibility and was told by both that these were infact BOTH compatible. 

A ploy to shun me off, shut me up so I thought they were in fact both incompatible with each other. Very unhelpful, I couldnt believe it as I spoke to Stuart on the phone after just spending £1400 on lenses.

Long story short I had to contact the manufacturer of both products and get clearance from them that they would repair both of my pieces of equipment under warranty.

After they were sent off Wex did not come back to me when the Lens was back with them from Sigma. I spoke to Wex a couple of weeks after my lens had been sent to Sigma and they said they had not heard anything back from them in regards to the lenses. I then had to speak to Sigma and they reported that the lens had in fact been sent straight back, going back to Wex they did eventually 'find' the lens ""oh yes we have the lens back"". 

A similar issue with the adapter which was being sent to Hong Kong, I was told this had been sent to Hong Kong for repair, but further down the line when chased, they said they had only just sent the product back (after about 4 weeks).

Will I be using or recommending Wex Photographic after my experience with their customer service? No I certainly wont, you have really left a sour taste in my mouth, trying to push the blame either back onto myself or onto the manufacturer. Absolutely disgusting attitude towards customer service and your clients... And to think 4 months prior I would have sung your praises... what a let down!!!!!!!",,2016-12-07T10:29:27Z,1,Zade Cross,,1

Poor delivery service,"The item was suppose to arrive next day delivery on Friday 14th Oct via Parcel Force. The tracking information indicated that it was all OK and would be delivered that day. After taking the whole day off to receive the parcel I was told at the end of the day that the parcel wasn't even on the van. I told the Parcel Force Manager that I needed the item as it was a replacement lens for my B camera and I was to use it at a wedding on the Saturday 15th and could the package be delivered as a Saturday delivery. This was agreed by the manager and I was told that the item would be with me before 12:00pm on Saturday. I contacted Wex that morning and asked them if they could check and make sure the lens was on the van as was to be delivered that morning. Wex called me back and told me that the item was definitely on the van and would be with me that day. No delivery. I contacted Wex again and was told that there would be nobody available at Parcel Force to answer the call to find out what has happened. I contacted Parcel Force myself on Monday morning and complained strongly at the way I had been treated in this matter. I was contacted again by Parcel Force and was told that the driver was on his way to me but he had become ill and had to phone for an Ambulance but also that the driver would wait until the relief driver arrived to take over the delivery, I can only imagine what was going through the minds of the Ambulance staff as they too waited for the relief driver to arrive and unable to take the 'casualty' to Hospital.

This company is a rip off, the customer service was useless the guy just said 'no, it says canon on the order form' but it was a used listing and it definitely said NIKON. I can't prove this because now that page is no longer visible, but (even if I made a mistake and it was somehow a canon lens) I would expect a respectable company to offer some kind of returns service.

Pure IDIOCY,"I bought a tripoid head from this shop. The locking mechanism was faulty. Not their fault, of course. I send it back for a replacement. 4 days later they contact me saying they are ready for a replacement to be sent out, but I forgot to return the head's plate and allen key that came with it. I have to send them back before the can send the replacement.

I politely remind them that they have a plate and allen key in the package of the replacement head they have ready to send out: why don't they take them out, keep them and send the rest?

Absolutely not, is the answer. ""You just can't do that"". Trying to reason turns out impossible. If I were speaking to a monkey I would have gone much further.

Poor customer service is an understatement!,"I have been left very frustrated and disappointed by the customer service from Wex. Having bought around £1700  worth of equipment on finance. I was left frustrated initially by the stock status online went from 5 to 7 working days to awaiting stock for my order.

I ordered the items on the 24th of July. After over a week I called to enquire about length of time my order will take and if the items are in stock at their distributors. A man called Terry could not provide me with any information and would be in touch with a date from distributors.  Few days of no response from Terry I called again and got a man called Paul. He again provided no date and promised to call or email me an update by 6pm regardless if he has any information or not..surprise no call or email from Paul.
The next day around 5.30pm I phoned and got through to Stuart, to whom I expressed my disappointment with the service thus far.

Stuart then informed me that only one item (a filter )
was out of stock from my order, I stated my urgency for the goods and understood that as I paid with finance I would have limited options in cancelling the filter to get the order, so I offered to pay additional money for another filter on top of finance , this simple procedure at first seemed an impossible task however after conferring with colleagues  I was greeted by news we could send out a complete order to myself on a next day delivery before 12pm!

Naturally I was ecstatic that Stuart took ownership of my stock issue and had resolved this.

So I book Friday as an admin day for work... and 12pm passes by. Around 2.45 I phone to check status of my delivery to find it had not even been processed. And that it will now be sent out for Saturday between 8 am and 1 pm.

No apology again just another poor excuse about an error from barclays their finance partner.

I would not be surprised if the goods don't even show up tomorrow. 
I will actively state to people I know not to buy from Wex based on my customer experience. And nor shall I ever purchase from them again.
Anyone else looking for camera equipment go to calumet,CVP, pro av, .. even jessops or curry's... they would look after their customers better.

I also notice that Wex respond on here to the people with bad experience with a bit of empathy and we will inform customer services etc, but other than a few words from Mark or Amanda on this they dont actually do anything for the customers.",,2016-08-05T14:22:15Z,1,David Scott,,6
Poor delivery service,"My order valued at £612 was delivered to the wrong address, despite giving updated delivery information to customer services. I had to trace the delivery myself to one of two post offices, spent a about two hours doing this and a further 45 minutes travelling to and waiting at two post offices. When I advised Wex of the problem, no apology was given. This is even more frustrating because I paid for next day delivery, although this was refunded later, an apology would have been nice.  I have used Wex a lot in the past, I won't be using them again because this was the second next day delivery order that was not recived, resulting in a lot of wasted time and effort on my part. Wex has lost a previous loyal customer.",,2016-07-31T07:47:50Z,1,Tony Gaskins,,9
Difficult Process,"So bad I was right at the point of cancelling the order. I spent several hours on the phone chasing and calling them to get my order sorted. There is a problem, but a total lack of communication between Wex and one of their service providers, with me stuck in the middle. 

Later I had a problem with the manufacturer not recognizing the serial number - did Wex help, hell no! 'it takes time for them to recognize the number' was their response, despite the manufacturer already stating it was not valid. Turns out it was a problem at the manufacturer problem and not Wex, but the complete lack of support (or reading of emails) from Wex shows how bad their support is.

For a simple order they may be ok, but for this they were an utter failure. It took the exciting process of getting a new camera and turned it into a nonstop hassle. I now seriously dislike this company and couldn't recommend against them more.",,2016-07-29T18:21:17Z,1,D Bartram,,5
I won't be using Wex again!,"There is nothing wrong with the goods supplied, and, with reference to the star rating, no one was rude to me. However, I had some major delivery problems ordering from this company which caused me great inconvenience and some cost, and that I consider to be unreasonable and unacceptable. Admittedly some of the problems may be due to their courier, Parcelforce, but I feel I was misled as to how my goods would be delivered, and if Wex could not meet my clearly stated delivery requirements they should have declined my order. In my phonecalls concerning my delivery, I didn't get the opinion anyone at Wex really cared once my goods had left their depot.

I cannot risk a repeat of this so will not be ordering any more equipment from Wex.

I wish other customers better luck with their ordering!",,2016-07-07T17:26:23Z,1,James,,15
Not good. Again.,"I recently enquired about delivery time for a Benro monopod so that I could make an informed choice on whether to order. I knew that Wex didn't have the monopod in stock but wanted to find out how long it would take to get it to my door. I had a specific day I needed it by and I was told it would take 5-7 days to get it to me including getting the item in stock at their end, which gave me just enough time, so I ordered. For some reason I never received a confirmation email of the order, so today I called Wex to check on it. At this point I was told by their representative that I was completely wrong about their delivery times and that their staff members would never have said that to me. When I asked to speak to a manager she simply laughed at me and told me to wait. As a customer, I have never been so poorly treated and I've certainly never been laughed at. I did speak to the manager in the end who was pretty helpful and looked back at the calls and confirmed that I had been given wrong information by the first guy I spoke to, however I have now missed my opportunity get hold of the kit I needed for my shoot, and I'm pretty annoyed about that to say the least.

Professional photographers or companies beware of Wex.,"I ordered an expensive 27 inch monitor from Wex for a professional project with a deadline. I paid extra for next day delivery. The parcel was delivered to the wrong address. I rang Wex the moment that I saw on the tracking that someone else had signed for my delivery and they were very unsympathetic and unhelpful. Rather than arrange for a substitute to be sent and to proactively try and remedy the situation, the manager of the store suggested that I should buy another screen for next day delivery. He also insisted that nothing would be done to refund me until the missing screen was found and returned to their HQ. I found the customer service representatives rude and unwilling to help. I completely missed my deadline, I am £900.00 out of pocket, I have had no feedback about the progress of the lost screen from Wex and I know that I will have to keep chasing them. I urge any professional photographer to think twice if you are ordering an item for a time sensitive project.

A very very very poor deal,"We purchased a Wacom Intuos Pro Professional Creative Pen and Touch Graphic Tablet - Large as a gift for my daughter costing £319.00 at the end of 2015. Sadly it was not something she wanted, and was too embarrassed to let us know. She didn't even open the box. We have only just found out that this was the case so I was hoping to get a fair deal from Wex if it was returned brand new, un-touched on the basis that I would also place an order for a camera (£590)

Their offer is £150. How they must hate customers!",,2016-02-23T11:27:23Z,1,Barney,"London, GB",50
ORDERED OVER 2 WEEKS AGO AND STILL WAITING,"They said they had order coming in that week. Over 2 weeks later, still nothing. This is unacceptable in this day and age, if you can track my steak from the paddock in grazed in to my plate, they can at least know when stock will arrive or not advertise it until they have the stock.
I have had this problem once before with WEX photographic, they advertise a product they don't have, keep you thinking it will come next week. This is to stop you from going to a competitor. In the end you wide up canceling the order after having your time wasted and then start looking for the product elsewhere.",,2015-12-19T23:46:46Z,1,ralph pinel,,4
Unhappy customer,"I placed my order for a Christmas present 10 days ago without issue. I received an email  telling me there had been an error and they didn't have any left in stock - despite their item being listed on their website as in stock and delivered before Christmas!
Wex had told me they'd be back in touch after a delivery on Friday - no contact and when I emailed to ask if I was getting the order or a refund I was sent 3 emails telling me they were sorry I wanted to cancel my order, (despite me not asking for one).
I'm now sitting here a week to go till Christmas with no present and the refund hasn't gone through yet! They have had my money for 10 days despite not honouring my delivery and I can't afford to buy from another company until I receive their refund so probably won't be able to get this in time, really disappointing.
I will never use this company again.
UPDATE: I still have not received my refund to my credit card and in order to get this item delivered tomorrow as per the Wex reply below I would need to pay again, thus making 2 payments, almost £200 - and still no item yet. I was told it may still be an additional 4-5 days before my original money was refunded so as I don't have the money to pay again (because they haven't given me the first refund yet!) there will be no order.",,2015-12-18T07:28:43Z,1,Elspeth Ewing,,3
"Horrible Service, Buyers Beware","I don't like writing bad reviews, but they really take the biscuit on this one...

I placed an order via their Barclays Finance option on the Saturday expecting delivery for Monday. Everything went through OK my end, but come Saturday evening my goods had not been posted out.

I contacted them Sunday asking what was going on, and they said it would need to be checked over by their finance department however no one is in until Monday.

Come Monday I was working so my fiance phoned up and they said there was a hold on the application by Barclays and they could not send it out...

After phoning Barclays they informed me that there was no hold on the application and everything is fine. I had a back and forth between Wex and Barclays on this one 3 or 4 times, Wex telling me one thing, Barclays telling me another.

I then get an email saying that Wex need to verify my identity before they can post the order out until I have sent them a scan of my driving license and a bank statement because ""They have no record of me living at this address”. Why?

Come Tuesday, order still pending. I contacted Wex and they said Barclays were still holding the application and they would not be able to send it out. I phone Barclays and they told me Wex had been paid for the goods and they were witholding the items without cause.

I contacted Wex again and they simply came back with the same answer, I tried explaining again that everything had been approved by Barclays and the advisor said “I’m not convinced”. I honestly feel like I’m being accused of lying about my order here.

Barclays then told me they would be filing a section 75 against them and putting an investigation on the company as to why they are not sending the goods out.

Forward to the Wednesday my fiancé spoke to Wex and they told him that they had contacted Barclays and that Barclays had no record of any conversation with myself. I phoned Barclays back again and they contacted Wex directly and must have kicked some butt because not 30 minutes later I had a call telling me that the order had been prepared to be dispatched.

I feel frustrated as I've had to put work back this week expecting my items... we rely on the money from the photography and can't afford these kinds of delays.

OK Positives: When Barclays had cleared it up with Wex the manager phoned my partner and were apologetic about the situation.

The item arrived the following day and was well packaged... Parcel force are a horrible service though, they like to break things.

Overall as a first time customer I am appalled and will NEVER be buying from Wex Photographic again. 

M.E.

Update to Response: If you had contacted Barclays directly as we had asked on many occasions, they would have told you everything was fine and there was no hold on the order. You had been fully paid pretty much right away.

If they go as far as saying they would put an investigation on your company because they see no reason for you not dispatching the goods, that says something about what's happened.

There may have been an overall hold as you say, however this order went through before this hold was made, so unfortunately going on Barclays word I will not be updating my review.",,2015-12-10T13:14:58Z,1,Mandy E,,1
Dreadful service and no communication,"When things go wrong you find out how good or in this case how bad the company is.
Placed an order November 30th for a Saturday delivery and paid additional cost. I must admit I had a bad feeling when the e-mail came through and it showed Parcelforce as the delivery agent. I have experienced them personally and in a business context and always found their service awful.
Waited in on Saturday for delivery and no show so phoned Wex and they confirmed that it had been shipped to Parcleforce but not delivered. Said they would chase this up Monday heard nothing from them Monday late morning,  so rang them up   was told Parcelforce can't find it and I would have to wait until it was found. Staff were placing blame on Parcelforce but as a customer the carrier you use reflects on the company so not really interested in the blame game just want my camera delivered. Gave them the work address to re-deliver to. 
Waited till Tues lunchtime still heard nothing so rang again to be told that it was out for re-delivery today. Knowing Parcelforce I asked them to check what address it is going to be delivered to, they rang back and of course it was to the wrong address! so a further delay and still don't have the camera.
The most annoying thing is the total lack of communication and customer care. Why can't they be bothered to e-mail or call, the staff seems to think this is the normal way to treat a customer and are aware of the carriers inadequacies- Clearly something the management should take note of.",,2015-12-08T13:01:08Z,1,Neil Burgin,,2
"Went wrong, but no help from Wex","I bought a camera from them last Friday with Saturday delivery option. I paid using Paypal, but they still managed to get my address wrong and the parcel went to different address. Thankfully for me the other addressee refused the parcel and it went back to the depot. Now, left alone by Wex I'm trying to straighten things up with the courier. It's Wednesday evening now and I still haven't got the camera. Courier says that they need confirmation from the sender regarding my purchase. Surprise, surprise. I have phoned and emailed Wex as soon as I spotted the problem on Monday with the address. I was assured on the phone that they will contact courier company providing my correct address. No reply to my email sent on Monday despite it meant to be within 24h. Something tells mi that they didn't bother, otherwise couriers would already know where to deliver the parcel.",,2015-10-28T18:04:58Z,1,Andrew,,2
Dreadful attitude when the mistake is theirs.,"This is not the first time I have been disappointed by the attitude of Wex when things go wrong. If everything is fine then they have done no more than they promise, but when it goes wrong they are appalling at putting it right.

I ordered two 'Nissin flashgun and commander' kits. However, when I opened the parcel I found that there was just one kit containing a flashgun and the commander, but the other was just a separate flashgun and not the kit.

When I telephoned I had to repeat the explanation of what I'd received three times, only to be told by the customer service advisor 'I'll have to check with the warehouse'. The manner and tone of her response clearly implied that she thought I may well be lying and this was confirmed when she asked for photographic proof.

She denied this when I objected strenuously, but still made no great efforts to correct the issue. At first she suggested that I return the unwanted item, but when I told her that she needed to arrange the replacement and collection, as I wasn't going to be doing anything of the sort, there followed a short conversation interspersed with her coughing sarcastically. In the end it proved too much and I had to hang up as I was absolutely livid.

Still furious I sent the picture of the wrong item and attempted confirmation via the 'live chat'. It's certainly tenuous to call it 'live' as it's like swimming through treacle.

Finally, having spent far too long on the issue I have received an email telling me the replacement will arrive tomorrow. Whether it will, and be the correct item, remains to be seen.

What should have occurred would have been a 30 second phone call:
I tell them they have sent the wrong item, they apologise and tell me they will immediately arrange a replacement. Ten minutes later I should get an email with the details.

Wex managed to turn that into something of a battle of wills, calling into question my honesty. To do so is an absolute disgrace and they should be ashamed of themselves.

As it is, even when it's resolved all I will have is what I paid for. Until then I'm nursing a blinding headache and do not have the items as ordered.

P.S. Following their reply:

Your explanation is a nonsense. It wouldn't matter if your warehouse had sent some sweepings off the floor, or a pink elephant, by mistake; all your representative needed to do was arrange a collection and send out the missing item.

As to 'upgraded delivery', it can never be what I paid for which was to be delivered today! So please don't expect me to be happy.",,2015-10-12T15:47:41Z,1,Peter Kelly,,28
wex asked me to stop buying equipement at their store,"over about 2 years i spent probably about £2000 at the norwich store. i liked to use the store because they give a no quibble customer satisfaction guarantee. some products i have bought have been faulty or just not functioning as described. i had confidence buying from them.  and have been able to return items..one day i went in and bought a trial cam, best part of £200, got it home, and as i was putting batteries in i thought, that is a very bad design, the batteries were not held in securely, i thought no worries ill try it out in the field, trusting that wex would sort it out. after finding out all about how the camera works i put it out at night to catch some deer activity. when i checked in the morning no images had been taken, and yet all food had gone from bait tray, camera was tested on aim...so unhappy with camera on 2 points i took it back to wex asking to try another make of camera, i was told that i would have to pay a restocking fee, if there was to be an exchange, i asked to speak to manager, and said manager went on to be pretty rude to me about terms and conditions,  who also reeked of tobaco smoke (having a bad day i suspect), and the fact that the customer satisfaction garantee was in fact optional on their part. i left the store advising wex that i  would take legal advise, and also to contact the head branch manager. citizens advise told me, as i thought that,  i was entitled to a full refund on faulty items. i emailed the branch manager and was told that they would refund my purchase price but i was never to buy anymore goods from them..i was told that the percentage of returned goods had gone above a certain number that was to high for the firm to tolerate and so my custom was terminated...during this process i received argumentative and rude emails from the shop manager,, the branch manager apologised for his shop managers behaviour.  so the morale of this is they sell a lot of good gear, and fair percentage of lacklustre gear, remember customer satisfaction is optional on there part, so you might need recourse to consumer law if there is a prob. i have now found other ways to buy my photographic equipement...
pps the reply by wex below is inaccurate, i was happy with the fact that the main boss apologise apologised for the fact that the sales manager had been down right rude to me. i was not happy in the slightest about how i was treated, yes they gave me a refund after me threatening them with legal recourse. the answer wex have given to this reveiw is making out it was all cool, it was not..wex has changed how it does business. use them with this knowledge.",,2015-09-30T21:18:36Z,1,nick,,4
Terrible service,"I had a truly bad experience ordering with Wex photographics.

"Amazon do it much better, and cheaper.","I placed an order for a flashgun on Friday the 3rd of July, and paid for 'next day delivery'. It did not arrive on the Saturday, and the tracking number supplied could not be found by Royal Mail. I was told by Wex that for some reason the parcel was not loaded for delivery, but it would be delivered on the Monday. On the Saturday I told them that I did not want the item as I had needed it for the Sunday. 'No problem' I was told. I was then told that they tried to deliver it on the Monday. I was home all day and nothing arrived. They would not refund the money until the item had been returned to them. I then later learned that Royal Mail supposedly tried to deliver it again on the Tuesday. Again, I was home all day and nothing arrived. Remember the 'No problem'. On the 10th of July I received an email from Wex that the item had been returned to them. Did the Royal Mail have the item for 7 days after they had supposedly been informed that it was to be returned on the 4th of July, but kept it for another 5 working days ? I do not believe it for a second. I contacted Wex today (13-07-15) to enquire when I would receive the refund, and was told that it had been processed, but the banks can take a few days to process the refund. Rubbish ! In these days of BACS transfers it does not take 'a few days'. 
Make up your own minds, but in my opinion if you can find what you want somewhere else, go for it. They are not exactly the cheapest for photographic equipment anyway. I for one will never purchase from them again in the future.",,2015-07-13T11:42:53Z,1,Barry Bolon,,1

They wouldn't send me a new one even if I offered to pay for it, as I still needed it. When they did arrange the collection for the item they sent the courier to the wrong address.

Too bad that security doesn't operate in the building until 6pm and that no one from Parcel Force registered at reception on that day.

When it arrived I noticed that it was in a ""body only"" box and I knew that Nikon were not selling body only in the UK. I checked with Nikon and it was indeed a grey import.

A chain is only as strong as the weakest link - ParcelFARCE!!!,"Ordered a camera bag with next day delivery for a trip abroad this week. Although, next day delivery becomes two day delivery with Parcelforce as they deem 25 miles from Glasgow as 'remote'! So order should have been delivered on Wednesday 4/9/2013. 

Now as we are 'remote', Parcelforce use the postman to do the final delivery. Delivery day comes and I wait all day. Postie comes at about 2pm but has nothing for me. Unsurprised I call Parcelforce to inform them that Royal Mail have not delivered anything. They say they will call the depot and get back to me. 5.30 arrives which is the published final delivery time, so I call back. ""Oh"" they say, ""Royal Mail are closed now so we can't do anything"". They assure me it will however arrive with the next days post. 

So Thursday arrives and I take another day off waiting for the elusive parcel to arrive. Postie stealthily delivers the mail at 2pm but has no parcels for me. I check the online tracking... ""In progress"" it says, and has done for two days. So I call Parcelforce once again. ""I will find out what is happening Sir and call you back"". Nothing. no call. Only after a further slightly more irate call do I get anywhere with them. ""It's at the Aberfoyle delivery office Sir"". Great, only 10 minutes away, so I hop in the car. Only it wasn't at the Aberfoyle delivery office and never had been. 

Time for me to contact WEX. Can't get through on the phone, technical problems apparently. So opting for the online live chat I try to get some answers. The live chat works and I manage to converse with someone. They check the tracking and confirm that the parcel has been handed off to Royal Mail but not delivered. Tell me something I don't know! They do however promise to get in touch with their Parcelforce rep and get back to me by email as the phone lines were down. I wait until the end of the day for a response, and having received nothing, I email WEX outlining my concerns.

Friday and I am in Glasgow. Two days overdue and still no progress made with either Parcelforce or WEX. Then, a response to my email from WEX the previous afternoon. The parcel has been signed for! what! Where? By whom? So onto Parcelforce tracking I go. It has been signed for, by me apparently, only I have never seen the parcel or signed anything. My signature has been forged. Not only that, but the date of delivery is 4/9/2013, the day it should have been delivered. I checked tracking on the 5th and it still said 'In Progress'. So i jump in the car and drive the 50 mile round trip to see if it has indeed been delivered, but it hasn't.  I'm straight on the phone to Parcelforce. ""Where the hell have you delivered my parcel?""... ""Sorry sir, Royal Mail are closed now, there is nothing we can do"" I try to call WEX. Phone lines still down, so I reply to the email, suggesting that as someone other than me seems to have my order they might want to use one of their mobile phones to call me. 

That is as far as I have got. Parcelforce customer service is limited at weekends and WEX don't have any. I have no parcel, WEX are refusing a refund because tracking now says delivered and Parcelforce couldn't give a monkeys""

I am absolutely amazed that neither party seems to care that there is fraud going on here. I first flagged a problem with this delivery on Wednesday afternoon. It is now Sunday evening and not a thing has been done about it.

WEX are great at taking your money. They also seem pretty good at dispatching orders in time. Where they fall down is their choice of courier and the after sales service.

I have spent hours trying to get to the bottom of this and driven over a hundred miles. I am considerably out of pocket. Question is who do I charge my time to and at what point do I inform the police of this apparent fraud? WEX? ....",,2013-09-08T16:50:18Z,1,Simon Evans,,2
I won't be using WEX again,"I have spent many thousands of pounds at WEX, on a range of camera equipment, including a whole new outfit, now I have turned professional. In the past, there have been two occasions where I have not received equipment on the day stated and it has caused frustration. This last time, I was let down once again and have lost out financially. I needed the lens to complete the kit for a 792 mile round trip. It didn't arrive in time. The loss in terms of my portfolio sales is only to be guessed at but it limited my options greatly.
I refused the order when it did arrive and have since received a full refund from WEX. Despite contacting them explaining the situation, this and a very short email is all I have received; they have either not understood the implications, feel it is all down to ParcelForce (which I presume it is - I have yet to hear) or simply don't care that they are losing my custom.
In the past I have been happy, but I am not now and have since ordered with LCE, who  got a lens to me within 24 hours.
For these reasons, I will not be using WEX again and have warned everyone else I know in the photography world of my experiences.
The good thing is it reminds me not to have such poor empathy with my customers.

One question that will no doubt be asked is ""what could WEX have done?"" Well, in my view, an acknowledgement, beyond the briefest 'sorry' and some attempt from them, to look into the shoddy service of the delivery company they employ. I would be asking questions of ParcelForce (I am, personally, but I mean if I were WEX).",,2013-08-09T13:13:56Z,1,Alec Murrell,"Dunkirk, GB",1

Over the next few months the returns procedure only seemed to move forward when we rang them to complain. Every time they'd have no idea what was going on only to make false promises of a return to us shortly.

Earlier this week I ordered a spotting scope and paid the extra for next day delivery. Unfortunately, mistakes can happen and I was sent the wrong scope. Wex did offer to reimburse the delivery charge but this did no way recompense me for the fact that I was stuck in the house for 8 hours waiting for the courier to arrive. I appreciate that Wex have no control over the couriers but merely offering me a £4.99 refund for wasting  8 hours of my time is not what I call customer service.  I explained to the Wex representative that I would have to go out for half an hour in the morning of the day the courier was due. He suggested that I put a note on my front door for the courier explaining that there would be nobody in for a short period of time!

Poor Product Knowledge And Atrocious Service By Rude Unhelpful People.,"Spoke to an employee for some product advice... I knew more about the product than he did. Sounded like he was reading direct from their website when I asked a couple of basic questions. Even so, I ordered £600 of lighting equipment and paid over the odds for it (over £50.00 cheeper at Calumet), but accepted the price, because they guaranteed next day delivery. And guess what.... no delivery the next day. On speaking to customer services that afternoon (still enough time to fix the order), I was told they didn't know what had happened, but the order hadn't been sent out and that they could resend it the next day. When I told them I was flying to a photo shoot first thing the next day and needed the equipment, they said there was nothing they could do. This was despite them being within easy driving distance of the delivery address. Apparently, it was all to do with insurance. When I told the employee that it wasn't a question of ""cant"", but ""unwilling"" to do anything about it, the rude little man at the end of the phone became short and dismissive. So I cancelled the order.
Thanks Wexphotographic for a truly abysmal level of service- I had heard several stories about your incompetence when it comes to dispatching orders on time, sending the wrong orders and poor customer service, but this is the first time I've been a victim of it. Mind you, it's the first (and last time) I've ever ordered from you. Statistically, in my experience, you've been incompetent and lazy, 100% of the time... good work fellas. Never again will I waste my time with you...

Catastrophic failure......,"I feel I must write and warn people of the service of this Co, or Warehouse Express in particular and pray your order isn't wrong.

I ordered back in November of 2012 a Christmas present for my nephew, a telescope for the clear skies in Scotland where they live. I instructed Wex to deliver and was told the package arrived, albeit a day later than told, but delivered nonetheless.

Only when I visited in the New Year, did I discover the new telescope, set up in the front room, wasn’t the model I’d ordered, in fact not even close. The scope they sent was at least £100 cheaper and would have gone unnoticed, only I made the trip to see family over the festive period. Not that I would presume to cast aspersions on a company of this size and mistakes are made, but the billing and delivery address is some 400 miles apart.

Now that the mistake came to light, I rang to ask what could be done. No apology was given by the call staff, but they agreed to collect so they could receive the goods back in the warehouse to inspect; then arrange delivery of the correct item. For a courier to pick up I was told I couldn’t have a pickup time or date, but someone would ring back to clarify. No one did. Ringing back I was told it wasn’t on the system, but ‘we can arrange for collection’? 

Following a call to Fedex myself, who can organise themselves, pickup was arranged. Approx. a week later I received an automated message saying the scope was back at Wex, but then again……. nothing.

Yet another call to the Warehouse ‘Express’, which prompted them to search if it had arrived from their supplier, and yes it will be delivered to Lancashire in the next few days……!?? Finally, and some 6 weeks in between and another day late, my nephew has a new telescope.

Thanks Wex for ruining the surprise and possibly his interest in the stars….",,2013-01-19T11:50:37Z,1,Burt Yenson,,2
Pray nothing goes wrong,"I've used Warehouse Express for years and would have always recommended them. However, in the past nothing I'd ever bought had been faulty. They say judge a retailer on their after service so that is what I'm doing. My Sony SLR had a faulty battery or charger (don't know which because the battery won't charge at all) so I sent them both back under instruction by Warehouse Express so they could return them to Sony. Well, after 5 weeks and hearing nothing I decided to chase as I felt 5 weeks was a fair and reasonable amount of time to have a £1000 camera sat gathering dust. My response, a quote of their terms and conditions that because I'm past 28 days I just have to wait on the manufacturer. Well, in actual fact, my contract is with them as per the law and it's only 4 months old so they are legally obliged to sort it. Shame they don't care about the law and also don't care that I've spent thousands of pounds with them over the years and are happy to just quote me terms and conditions. Off to the Trading Standards I go and still no camera. Don't be fooled by the prices, think carefully about what happens when it goes wrong. Go to Amazon, 10 times better.",,2012-04-19T12:12:21Z,1,JN,,17
Unsympathetic towards failed flash gun,"Had a Metz Flash gun I bought in 2009 stop working, only used 30 times and still in its original box. Thought it would last longer than that. Warehouse Express not interested said tough the warranty is 6 months and I'm out of it unless I can prove the unit was already on its way out during the warranty period.",,2011-03-08T20:03:42Z,1,dave,,1

They send broken goods to customers knowing they are broken!,"I bought a photography lighting kit and after 4 weeks of hassle and 2 kits BOTH BROKEN they where trying to pawn me off with replacement bulbs. After some discussion over checking the lights are fine before despatch is was clear they knew full well the whole stock where broken and still sold onto the customers! At that point i demanded a refund! I refuse to purchase from a company who does that to their customers!

Part of me believes they might purposly buy lights with broken bulbs, as it easily happens, then they can get a cheaper price! Surely if a big company recieves broken goods they would get replacements from the manufacturer since they give them £1000's. However warehouse express seems quite happy to sell on these goods!

So 4 weeks later i have no lights, mountains of stress and lost work from sitting in waiting for deliveries. If your going to purchase from them dont expect a quality service!",,2009-02-17T18:52:55Z,1,Chloe,"Cambridgeshire, GB",3
