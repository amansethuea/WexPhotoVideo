2024-07-04T22:30:26Z,2,Trustpilot,0,"i decided to use wex to sell my sony a7riia and 2 lens for cash and also purchase a used fuji x100f on finance. after receiving my quote i sent my gear down for appraisal. the next day i also bought a used fuji x100f  on finance from wex web sales. while still waiting for a final quote for my sony gear, my used fuji was delivered. on initial inspection it became clear that the viewfinder shutter was faulty. this fault would have been obvious to notice before shipping from wex. i have since returned the fuji to wex in order for it to be repaired under there used 12 month guarantee. after there appraisal wex agreed with my grading of the sony camera and lens. unfortunately they informed me the quote for the camera body would be reduced from £850 down to £684. there stated reason was that the camera was an import and had 2 faults that needed to be repaired before they would buy it. the faults were minimal feedback when using the fn button and a intermittently stiff rear scroll wheel. they offered to send the camera away for a no obligation repair quote and if i agreed to the repair the cost would come of my final offer price i sold my 2 lens to them but asked for the camera body to be returned to me. after getting the camera body back i could not identify where they had seen fault. the fn button and rear wheel all were working great. in regard to the camera being an import, it is 5 years old and well out of the sony manufacturers warranty. it is as described by me and wex a grade 9 used camera. i sent the camera body to mpb. com 2 days ago. they found no faults and today i received £870 for the camera body. looking forward to receiving my fuji x100f after the repair.",Negative,{'Electronics'}
