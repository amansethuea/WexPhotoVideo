"I visited the shop in Norwich with a combination of old lenses, used camera's and accessories for trade in/up to buy a new camera to ideally take away on the day. The sales assistant (Dave) worked with me for around 1.5hrs to work through this. His product knowledge was excellent, everything I wanted was in stock and he worked through the trade in/up, money off etc offers to come up with the best price. Great service. Couldn't have been better.",2024-08-18T17:56:08Z,5,Trustpilot

"This was not the first pre-owned item that i have purchased from Wex and i would not hesitate to use them again.
The description is always very accurate and priced well.
I also traded in a Lens that i have not used for a while.(just sitting in the draw).Was offered more than i expected and used this to purchase a camera body.
So i would advise you all, if its not used sell it.
Must also add both transaction where very quick and trouble free",2024-08-18T09:43:56Z,5,Trustpilot
