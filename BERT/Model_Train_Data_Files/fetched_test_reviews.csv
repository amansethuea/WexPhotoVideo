"I decided to use WEX to sell my Sony A7riiia and 2 lens for cash and also purchase a used Fuji X100F on finance.
After receiving my quote I sent my gear down for appraisal. The next day I also bought a used Fuji X100F (grade 9) on finance from WEX web sales.
While still waiting for a final quote for my Sony gear, my used Fuji was delivered. On initial inspection it became clear that the viewfinder shutter was faulty. This fault would have been obvious to notice before shipping from WEX. I've since returned the Fuji  to WEX in order for it to be repaired under there used 12 month guarantee.
After there appraisal WEX agreed with my Grading of the Sony camera and lens(Grade 9 excellent). Unfortunately they informed me the quote for the camera body would be reduced from £850 down to £684. There stated reason was that the camera was an import and had 2 faults that needed to be repaired before they would buy it. The faults were ""minimal feedback"" when using the fn button and a ""intermittently stiff"" rear scroll wheel. They offered  to send the camera away for a no obligation repair quote and if I agreed to the repair the cost would come of my final offer price(£684 minus repair cost) I sold my 2 lens to them but asked for the camera body to be returned to me.
After getting the camera body back I couldn't identify where they had seen fault. The fn button and rear wheel all were working great. In regard to the camera being an ""import"", it is 5 years old and ""well out"" of the Sony Manufacturers warranty. It is as described by me and WEX a grade 9 used camera.
I sent the camera body to mpb.com 2 days ago. They found no faults and today I received £870 for the Camera body.
Looking forward to receiving my Fuji X100f after the repair.  ",2024-07-04T22:30:26Z,2,Trustpilot

Excellent price for a £700 Epson photo printer - the cheapest I found by £50 and over £150 less than the manufacturers rrp. I was able to choose which day it was delivered by DPD which was really useful. Delivery was problem free - the printer arrived in perfect condition. Very happy with this purchase!,2024-07-04T13:06:11Z,5,Trustpilot

"I ordered a lens from Wex and went on the waiting list for new stock. Wex were very thorough in keeping me updated about the status of the order periodically. I had been away when the lens arrived in stock and it was held onto due to my notification that I was away. As agreed, the lens arrived on that agreed date. Fantastic efficient service and excellent customer focus. Well done.",2024-07-04T11:00:33Z,5,Trustpilot
