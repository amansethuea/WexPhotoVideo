4,PowerReviews,2,ordered a used sigma 28-70 for l mount at a great price. had quite a few issues with the website when ordering on my phone so i had to remove the item from my basket and try again on my computer which did panic me a bit as i did not want someone to swoop in. never ordered from wex before but many friends trust them and they seem to be incredibly well established.,74
